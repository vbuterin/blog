<title> Endnotes on 2020: Crypto and Beyond </title>

<p>I'm writing this sitting in Singapore, the city in which I've now
spent nearly half a year of uninterrupted time - an unremarkable
duration for many, but for myself the longest I've stayed in any one
place for nearly a decade. After months of fighting what may perhaps
even be humanity's first boss-level enemy since 1945, the city itself is
close to normal, though the world as a whole and its 7.8 billion
inhabitants, normally so close by, continue to be so far away. Many
other parts of the world have done less well and suffered more, though
there is now a light at the end of the tunnel, as hopefully <a
href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations">rapid deployment of
vaccines</a> will help humanity as a whole overcome this great
challenge.</p>
<p>2020 has been a strange year because of these events, but also
others. As life "<a
href="https://gizmodo.com/pirate-bay-trial-watch-day-5-omg-is-this-happening-ir-5157197">away
from keyboard (AFK)</a>" has gotten much more constrained and
challenging, the internet has been supercharged, with consequences both
good and bad. Politics around the world has gone in strange directions,
and I am continually worried by the many political factions that are so
easily abandoning their most basic principles because they seem to have
decided that their (often mutually contradictory) personal causes are
just too important. And yet at the same time, there are rays of hope
coming from unusual corners, with <a

technological <a

- that could open up a new chapter for humanity finally coming to
fruition.</p>

<p>And so, 2020 is as good a year as any to ponder a key question: how
should we re-evaluate our models of the world? What ways of seeing,
understanding and reasoning about the world are going to be more useful
in the decades to come, and what paths are no longer as valuable? What
paths did we not see before that were valuable all along? In this post,
I will give some of my own answers, covering far from everything but
digging into a few specifics that seem particularly interesting. It's
sometimes hard to tell which of these ideas are a recognition of a
changing reality, and which are just myself finally seeing what has
always been there; often enough it's some of both. The answers to these
questions have a deep relevance both to the crypto space that I call
home as well as to the wider world.</p>
<h2 id="the-changing-role-of-economics">The Changing Role of
Economics</h2>
<p><strong>Economics has historically focused on "goods" in the form of
physical objects</strong>: production of food, manufacturing of widgets,
buying and selling houses, and the like. Physical objects have some
particular properties: they can be transferred, destroyed, bought and
sold, but not copied. If one person is using a physical object, it's
usually impractical for another person to use it simultaneously. Many
objects are only valuable if "consumed" outright. Making ten copies of
an object requires something close to ten times the resources that it
takes to make one (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale">not quite ten
times</a>, but surprisingly close, especially at larger scales).
<strong>But on the internet, very different rules apply.</strong>
Copying is cheap. I can write an article or a piece of code once, and it
usually takes quite a bit of effort to write it once, but once that work
is done, an unlimited number of people can download and enjoy it. Very
few things are "consumable"; often products are superseded by better
ones, but if that does not happen, something produced today may continue
to provide value to people until the end of time.</p>
<p><strong>On the internet, "public goods" take center stage</strong>.
Certainly, private goods exist, particularly in the form of individuals'
scarce attention and time and virtual assets that command that
attention, but the <em>average</em> interaction is one-to-many, not
one-to-one. Confounding the situation even further, the "many" rarely
maps easily to our traditional structures for structuring one-to-many
interactions, such as companies, cities or countries;. Instead, these
public goods are typically public across a widely scattered collection
of people all around the world. Many online platforms serving wide
groups of people need governance, to decide on features, content
moderation policies or other challenges important to their user
community, though there too, the user community rarely maps cleanly to
anything but itself. How is it fair for the US government to govern
Twitter, when Twitter is often a platform for public debates between US
politicians and representatives of its geopolitical rivals? But clearly,
governance challenges exist - and so we need more creative
solutions.</p>
<p>This is not merely of interest to "pure" online services. Though
goods in the physical world - food, houses, healthcare, transportation -
continue to be as important as ever, <em>improvements</em> in these
goods depend even more than before on technology, and technological
progress <em>does</em> happen over the internet.</p>
<br>

<br><br> <i><small>Examples of important public goods in the Ethereum
ecosystem that were funded by the
<a href="../../../2020/10/18/round7.html">recent Gitcoin quadratic
funding round</a>. Open source software ecosystems, including
blockchains, are hugely dependent on public goods.</small></i><br><br>
</center>
<p>But also, <strong>economics itself seems to be a less powerful tool
in dealing with these issues</strong>. Out of all the challenges of
2020, how many can be understood by looking at supply and demand curves?
One way to see what is going on here is by looking at the relationship
between <em>economics</em> and <em>politics</em>. In the 19th century,
the two were frequently viewed as being tied together, a subject called
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_economy">political
economy</a>". In the 20th century, the two are more typically split
apart. But in the 21st century, the lines between "private" and "public"
are once again rapidly blurring. Governments are <a
href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/miami-mayor-urges-wall-street-firms-to-leave-new-york-for-friendlier-south-florida">behaving
more like market actors</a>, and corporations are <a
href="https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1184306553089753088">behaving
more like governments</a>.</p>
<p>We see this merge happening in the crypto space as well, as the
researchers' eye of attention is increasingly switching focus to the
challenge of governance. Five years ago, the main economic topics being
considered in the crypto space had to do with consensus theory. This is
a tractable economics problem with clear goals, and so we would on
several occasions obtain nice clean results like <a
href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ie53/publications/btcProcFC.pdf">the
selfish mining paper</a>. Some points of subjectivity, like <a
href="https://news.earn.com/quantifying-decentralization-e39db233c28e?gi=dec44cdbf1ea">quantifying
decentralization</a>, exist, but they could be easily encapsulated and
treated separately from the formal math of the mechanism design. But in
the last few years, we have seen the rise of increasingly complicated
financial protocols and DAOs on top of blockchains, and at the same time
governance challenges <em>within</em> blockchains. Should Bitcoin Cash
<a href="https://www.bitcoinabc.org/2020-02-15-miner-fund/">redirect
12.5% of its block reward</a> toward paying a developer team? If so, who
decides who that developer team is? Should Zcash <a
href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/future-of-zcash-dev-funding-megathread-everything-in-one-place/34063">extend
its 20% developer reward</a> for another four years? These problems
certainly can be analyzed economically to some extent, but the analysis
inevitably gets stuck at concepts like <a
href="../../../2020/09/11/coordination.html">coordination</a>, <a
href="../../../2017/12/17/voting.html">flipping between equilibria</a>,
"Schelling points" and "legitimacy", that are much more difficult to
express with numbers. And so, a hybrid discipline, combining formal
mathematical reasoning with the softer style of humanistic reasoning, is
required.</p>
<h2 id="we-wanted-digital-nations-instead-we-got-digital-nationalism">We
wanted digital nations, instead we got digital nationalism</h2>
<p>One of the most fascinating things that I noticed fairly early in the
crypto space starting from around 2014 is just how quickly it started
replicating the political patterns of the world at large. I don't mean
this just in some broad abstract sense of "people are forming tribes and
attacking each other", I mean similarities that are surprisingly deep
and specific.</p>
<p><strong>First, the story</strong>. From 2009 to about 2013, the
Bitcoin world was a relatively innocent happy place. The community was
rapidly growing, prices were rising, and disagreements over block size
or long-term direction, while present, were largely academic and took up
little attention compared to the shared broader goal of helping Bitcoin
grow and prosper.</p>
<p>But in 2014, the schisms started to arise. Transaction volumes <a
href="https://www.blockchain.com/charts/avg-block-size">on the Bitcoin
blockchain</a> hit 250 kilobytes per block and kept rising, for the
first time raising fears that blockchain usage might actually hit the 1
MB limit before the limit could be increased. Non-Bitcoin blockchains,
up until this point a minor sideshow, suddenly became a major part of
the space, with Ethereum itself arguably leading the charge. And it was
during these events that disagreements that were before politely hidden
beneath the surface suddenly blew up. "Bitcoin maximalism", the idea
that the goal of the crypto space should not be a diverse ecosystem of
cryptocurrencies generally but Bitcoin and Bitcoin alone specifically,
grew from <a
href="http://themisescircle.org/blog/2013/08/22/the-problem-with-altcoins/">a
niche curiosity</a> into a prominent and angry movement that Dominic
Williams and I quickly saw for what it is and gave <a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/20/bitcoin-maximalism-currency-platform-network-effects/">its
current name</a>. The small block ideology, arguing that the block size
should be increased very slowly or even never increased at all
regardless of how high transaction fees go, began to take root.</p>
<p>The disagreements within Bitcoin would soon turn into an all-out
civil war. Theymos, the operator of the <a
href="https://reddit.com/r/bitcoin">/r/bitcoin</a> subreddit and several
other key public Bitcoin discussion spaces, resorted to <a
href="https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43">extreme
censorship</a> to impose his (small-block-leaning) views on the
community. In response, the big-blockers moved to a new subreddit, <a
href="https://reddit.com/r/btc">/r/btc</a>. Some valiantly attempted to
defuse tensions with diplomatic conferences including <a
href="https://medium.com/@bitcoinroundtable/bitcoin-roundtable-consensus-266d475a61ff">a
famous one in Hong Kong</a>, and a seeming consensus was reached, though
one year later the small block side would end up reneging on its part of
the deal. By 2017, the big block faction was firmly on its way to
defeat, and in August of that year they would secede (or "fork off") to
implement their own vision on their own separate continuation of the
Bitcoin blockchain, which they called "Bitcoin Cash" (symbol BCH).</p>
<p>The community split was chaotic, and one can see this in how the
channels of communication were split up in the divorce: <a
href="http://reddit.com/r/bitcoin">/r/bitcoin</a> stayed under the
control of supporters of Bitcoin (BTC). <a
href="http://reddit.com/r/btc">/r/btc</a> was controlled by supporters
of Bitcoin Cash (BCH). <a href="https://bitcoin.org">Bitcoin.org</a> was
controlled by supporters of Bitcoin (BTC). <a
href="https://bitcoin.com">Bitcoin.com</a> on the other hand was
controlled by supporters of Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Each side claimed
themselves to be the true Bitcoin. The result looked remarkably similar
to one of those civil wars that happens from time to time that results
in a country splitting in half, the two halves calling themselves almost
identical names that differ only in which subset of the words
"democratic", "people's" and "republic" appears on each side. Neither
side had the ability to destroy the other, and of course there was no
higher authority to adjudicate the dispute.</p>

</center>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Around the same time, Ethereum had its own chaotic
split</strong>, in the form of <a
href="https://qz.com/730004/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ethereum-hard-fork/">the
DAO fork</a>, a highly controversial resolution to a theft in which over
$50 million was stolen from the first major smart contract application
on Ethereum. Just like in the Bitcoin case, there was first a civil war
- though only lasting four weeks - and then a chain split, followed by
an online war between the two now-separate chains, Ethereum (ETH) and
Ethereum Classic (ETC). The naming split was as fun as in Bitcoin: the
Ethereum Foundation held <a
href="https://twitter.com/ethereumproject">ethereumproject on
Twitter</a> but Ethereum Classic supporters held <a
href="https://github.com/ethereumproject">ethereumproject on
Github</a>.</p>
<p>Some on the Ethereum side would argue that Ethereum Classic had very
few "real" supporters, and the whole thing was mostly a social attack by
Bitcoin supporters: either to support the version of Ethereum that
aligned with their values, or to cause chaos and destroy Ethereum
outright. I myself believed these claims somewhat at the beginning,
though over time I came to realize that they were overhyped. It is true
that some Bitcoin supporters had certainly tried to shape the outcome in
their own image. But to a large extent, as is the case in many
conflicts, the "foreign interference" card was simply a psychological
defense that many Ethereum supporters, myself included, subconsciously
used to shield ourselves from the fact that many people within our own
community really did have different values. Fortunately relations
between the two currencies have since improved - in part thanks to the
excellent diplomatic skills of <a href="http://virgil.gr/">Virgil
Griffith</a> - and Ethereum Classic developers have even agreed to move
to a different Github page.</p>
<p>Civil wars, <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCW2EaBjVPs">alliances</a>, blocs,
alliances with participants in civil wars, you can all find it in
crypto. Though fortunately, the conflict is all virtual and online,
without the extremely harmful in-person consequences that often come
with such things happening in real life. So what can we learn from all
this? One important takeaway is this: if phenomena like this happen in
contexts as widely different from each other as conflicts between
countries, conflicts between religions and relations within and between
purely digital cryptocurrencies, then perhaps what we're looking at is
the indelible epiphenomena of human nature - something much more
difficult to resolve than by changing what kinds of groups we organize
in. So we should expect situations like this to continue to play out in
many contexts over the decades to come. And perhaps it's harder than we
thought to separate the good that may come out of this from the bad:
those same energies that drive us to fight also drive us to
contribute.</p>
<h2 id="what-motivates-us-anyway">What motivates us anyway?</h2>
<p>One of the key intellectual undercurrents of the 2000s era was the
recognition of the importance of non-monetary motivations. People are
motivated not just by earning as much money as possible in the work and
extracting enjoyment from their money in their family lives; even at
work we are motivated by social status, honor, altruism, reciprocity, a
feeling of contribution, different social conceptions of what is good
and valuable, and much more.</p>
<p>These differences are very meaningful and measurable. For one
example, see <a
href="https://www.econ.uzh.ch/static/wp/econwp353.pdf">this Swiss
study</a> on compensating differentials for immoral work - how much
extra do employers have to pay to convince someone to do a job if that
job is considered morally unsavory?</p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/endnotes-files/swisspaper.png"
class="padded" /></p>
<p>As we can see, the effects are massive: if a job is widely considered
immoral, you need to pay employees almost twice as much for them to be
willing to do it. From personal experience, I would even argue that this
understates the case: in many cases, top-quality workers would not be
willing to work for a company that they think is bad for the world at
almost any price. "Work" that is difficult to formalize (eg.
word-of-mouth marketing) functions similarly: if people think a project
is good, they will do it for free, if they do not, they will not do it
at all. This is also likely why blockchain projects that raise a lot of
money but are unscrupulous, or even just corporate-controlled
profit-oriented "VC chains", tend to fail: even a billion dollars of
capital cannot compete with a project <em>having a soul</em>.</p>
<p>That said, it is possible to be overly idealistic about this fact, in
several ways. First of all, <strong>while this decentralized,
non-market, non-governmental subsidy toward projects that are socially
considered to be good is massive, likely amounting to tens of trillions
of dollars per year globally, its effect is not infinite</strong>. If a
developer has a choice between earning $30,000 per year by being
"ideologically pure", and making a $30 million ICO by sticking a
needless token into their project, they <em>will</em> do the latter.
Second, idealistic motivations are <em>uneven</em> in what they
motivate. Rick Falkvinge's <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Swarmwise-Tactical-Manual-Changing-World/dp/1463533152">Swarmwise</a>
played up the possibility of decentralized non-market organization in
part by pointing to political activism as a key example. And this is
true, political activism does not require getting paid. But longer and
more grueling tasks, even something as simple as <a
href="https://www.quora.com/Why-does-open-source-software-usually-have-poor-UI-and-UX-design-What-can-be-done-to-improve-this">making
good user interfaces</a>, are not so easily intrinsically motivated. And
so if you rely on intrinsic motivation too much, you get projects where
some tasks are overdone and other tasks are done poorly, or even ignored
entirely. And third, perceptions of what people find intrinsically
attractive to work on may change, and may even be manipulated.</p>
<p>One important conclusion for me from this is the importance of
culture (and that oh-so-important word that crypto influencers have
unfortunately ruined for me, <em>"narrative"</em>). If a project having
a high moral standing is equivalent to that project having twice as much
money, or even more, then culture and narrative are extremely powerful
forces that command the equivalent of tens of trillions of dollars of
value. And this does not even begin to cover the role of such concepts
in shaping our perceptions of legitimacy and coordination. And so
anything that influences the culture can have a great impact on the
world and on people's financial interests, and we're going to see more
and more sophisticated efforts from all kinds of actors to do so
systematically and deliberately. This is the darker conclusion of the
importance of non-monetary social motivations - they create the
battlefield for the permanent and final frontier of war, the war that is
fortunately not usually deadly but unfortunately impossible to create
peace treaties for because of how inextricably subjective it is to
determine what even counts as a battle: the culture war.</p>
<h2 id="big-x-is-here-to-stay-for-all-x">Big X is here to stay, for all
X</h2>
<p>One of the great debates of the 20th century is that between "Big
Government" and "Big Business" - with various permutations of each: Big
Brother, Big Banks, Big Tech, also at times joining the stage. In this
environment, the Great Ideologies were typically defined by trying to
abolish the Big X that they <em>disliked</em>: communism focusing on
corporations, anarcho-capitalism on governments, and so forth. Looking
back in 2020, one may ask: which of the Great Ideologies succeeded, and
which failed?</p>
<p>Let us zoom into one specific example: the 1996 <a
href="https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence">Declaration of
Independence of Cyberspace</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and
steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the
future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome
among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the similarly-spirited <a
href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/crypto/cypherpunks/may-crypto-manifesto.html">Crypto-Anarchist
Manifesto</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for
individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a
totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange messages, conduct
business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the
True Name, or legal identity, of the other. Interactions over networks
will be untraceable, via extensive re-routing of encrypted packets and
tamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic protocols with nearly
perfect assurance against any tampering. Reputations will be of central
importance, far more important in dealings than even the credit ratings
of today. These developments will alter completely the nature of
government regulation, the ability to tax and control economic
interactions, the ability to keep information secret, and will even
alter the nature of trust and reputation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How have these predictions fared? The answer is interesting: I would
say that they succeeded in one part and failed in the other. What
succeeded? We have interactions over networks, we have powerful
cryptography that is difficult for even state actors to break, we even
have powerful <em>cryptocurrency</em>, with smart contract capabilities
that the thinkers of the 1990s mostly did not even anticipate, and we're
increasingly moving toward anonymized reputation systems <a

zero knowledge proofs</a>. What failed? Well, the government did not go
away. And what just proved to be totally unexpected? Perhaps the most
interesting plot twist is that the two forces are, a few exceptions
notwithstanding, by and large <em>not</em> acting like mortal enemies,
and there are even many people within governments that are earnestly
trying to find ways to be friendly to blockchains and cryptocurrency and
new forms of cryptographic trust.</p>
<p>What we see in 2020 is this: Big Government is as powerful as ever,
but Big Business is <em>also</em> as powerful as ever. "<a
href="https://www.amazon.sg/Revolt-Public-Crisis-Authority-Millennium/dp/1732265143">Big
Protest Mob</a>" is as powerful as ever too, as is Big Tech, and soon
enough perhaps Big Cryptography. It's a densely populated jungle, with
an uneasy peace between many complicated actors. If you define success
as the total absence of a category of powerful actor or even a category
of activity that you dislike, then you will probably leave the 21st
century disappointed. But if you define success more through what
happens than through what doesn't happen, and you are okay with
imperfect outcomes, there is enough space to make everyone happy.</p>

<p>So we have a world where:</p>
<ul>
<li>One-to-one interactions are less important, one-to-many and
many-to-many interactions are more important.</li>
<li>The environment is much more <em>chaotic</em>, and difficult to
model with clean and simple equations. Many-to-many interactions
particularly follow strange rules that we still do not understand
well.</li>
<li>The environment is <em>dense</em>, and different categories of
powerful actors are forced to live quite closely side by side with each
other.</li>
</ul>
<p>In some ways, this is a world that is less convenient for someone
like myself. I grew up with a form of economics that is focused on
analyzing simpler physical objects and buying and selling, and am now
forced to contend with a world where such analysis, while not
irrelevant, is significantly less relevant than before. That said,
transitions are always challenging. In fact, transitions are
particularly challenging for those who think that they are not
challenging because they think that the transition merely confirms what
they believed all along. If you are still operating today precisely
according to a script that was created in 2009, when the Great Financial
Crisis was the most recent pivotal event on anyone's mind, then there
are almost certainly important things that happened in the last decade
that you are missing. An ideology that's finished is an ideology that's
dead.</p>
<p>It's a world where blockchains and cryptocurrencies are well poised
to play an important part, though for reasons much more complex than
many people think, and having as much to do with cultural forces as
anything financial (one of the more underrated bull cases for
cryptocurrency that I have always believed is simply the fact that
<em>gold is lame</em>, the younger generations realize that it's lame,
and that <a
href="https://www.goldeneaglecoin.com/Guide/value-of-all-the-gold-in-the-world">$9
trillion</a> has to go <em>somewhere</em>). Similarly complex forces are
what will lead to blockchains and cryptocurrencies being
<em>useful</em>. It's easy to <em>say</em> that any application can be
done more efficiently with a centralized service, but in practice social
coordination problems are very real, and unwillingness to sign onto a
system that has even a <em>perception</em> of non-neutrality or ongoing
dependence on a third party is real too. And so the centralized and even
consortium-based approaches claiming to replace blockchains don't get
anywhere, while "dumb and inefficient" public-blockchain-based solutions
just keep quietly moving forward and gaining actual adoption.</p>
<p>And finally it's a very multidisciplinary world, one that is much
harder to break up into layers and analyze each layer separately. You
may need to switch from one style of analysis to another style of
analysis in mid-sentence. Things happen for strange and inscrutable
reasons, and there are always surprises. The question that remains is:
how do we adapt to it?</p>
