<title> A Quick Garbled Circuits Primer </title>

<p><em>Special thanks to Dankrad Feist for review</em></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbled_circuit">Garbled
circuits</a> are a quite old, and surprisingly simple, cryptographic
primitive; they are quite possibly the simplest form of general-purpose
"multi-party computation" (MPC) to wrap your head around.</p>
<p>Here is the usual setup for the scheme:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppose that there are two parties, Alice and Bob, who want to
compute some function <code>f(alice_inputs, bob_inputs)</code>, which
takes inputs from both parties. Alice and Bob want to both learn the
result of computing <code>f</code>, but Alice does not want Bob to learn
her inputs, and Bob does not want Alice to learn his inputs. Ideally,
they would both learn nothing except for just the output of
<code>f</code>.</li>
<li>Alice performs a special procedure ("garbling") to encrypt a circuit
(meaning, a set of AND, OR... gates) which evaluates the function
<code>f</code>. She passes along inputs, also encrypted in a way that's
compatible with the encrypted circuit, to Bob.</li>
<li>Bob uses a technique called "1-of-2 oblivious transfer" to learn the
encrypted form of his own inputs, without letting Alice know which
inputs he obtained.</li>
<li>Bob runs the encrypted circuit on the encrypted data and gets the
answer, and passes it along to Alice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Extra cryptographic wrappings can be used to protect the scheme
against Alice and Bob sending wrong info and giving each other an
incorrect answer; we won't go into those here for simplicity, though it
suffices to say "wrap a ZK-SNARK around everything" is one (quite heavy
duty and suboptimal!) solution that works fine.</p>
<p>So how does the basic scheme work? Let's start with a circuit:</p>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/garbled/circuit.png" class="padded" />
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>This is one of the simplest examples of a not-completely-trivial
circuit that actually does something: it's a two-bit adder. It takes as
input two numbers in binary, each with two bits, and outputs the
three-bit binary number that is the sum.</p>
<p>Now, let's encrypt the circuit. First, for every input, we randomly
generate two "labels" (think: 256-bit numbers): one to represent that
input being 0 and the other to represent that input being 1. Then we
also do the same for every intermediate wire, not including the output
wires. Note that this data is not part of the "garbling" that Alice
sends to Bob; so far this is just setup.</p>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/garbled/circuit2.png" class="padded" />
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now, for every gate in the circuit, we do the following. For every
combination of inputs, we include in the "garbling" that Alice provides
to Bob the label of the output (or if the label of the output is a
"final" output, the output directly) encrypted with a key generated by
hashing the input labels that lead to that output together. For
simplicity, our encryption algorithm can just be
<code>enc(out, in1, in2) = out + hash(k, in1, in2)</code> where
<code>k</code> is the index of the gate (is it the first gate in the
circuit, the second, the third?). If you know the labels of both inputs,
and you have the garbling, then you can learn the label of the
corresponding output, because you can just compute the corresponding
hash and subtract it out.</p>
<p>Here's the garbling of the first XOR gate:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Inputs</th>
<th>Output</th>
<th>Encoding of output</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>00</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0 + hash(1, 6816, 6529)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>01</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1 + hash(1, 6816, 4872)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>10</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1 + hash(1, 8677, 6529)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>11</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0 + hash(1, 8677, 4872)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Notice that we are including the (encrypted forms of) 0 and 1
directly, because this XOR gate's outputs are directly final outputs of
the program. Now, let's look at the leftmost AND gate:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Inputs</th>
<th>Output</th>
<th>Encoding of output</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>00</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>5990 + hash(2, 6816, 6529)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>01</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>5990 + hash(2, 6816, 4872)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>10</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>5990 + hash(2, 8677, 6529)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>11</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1921 + hash(2, 8677, 4872)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Here, the gate's outputs are just used as inputs to other gates, so
we use labels instead of bits to hide these intermediate bits from the
evaluator.</p>
<p>The "garbling" that Alice would provide to Bob is just everything in
the third column for each gate, with the rows of each gate re-ordered
(to avoid revealing whether a given row corresponds to a 0 or a 1 in any
wire). To help Bob learn which value to decrypt for each gate, we'll use
a particular order: for each gate, the first row becomes the row where
both input labels are even, in the second row the second label is odd,
in the third row the first label is odd, and in the fourth row both
labels are odd (we deliberately chose labels earlier so that each gate
would have an even label for one output and an odd label for the other).
We garble every other gate in the circuit in the same way.</p>
<p>All in all, Alice sends to Bob four ~256 bit numbers for each gate in
the circuit. It turns out that four is far from optimal; see <a
href="http://web.mit.edu/sonka89/www/papers/2017ygc.pdf">here</a> for
some optimizations on how to reduce this to three or even two numbers
for an AND gate and zero (!!) for an XOR gate. Note that these
optimizations do rely on some changes, eg. using XOR instead of addition
and subtraction, though this should be done anyway for security.</p>
<p>When Bob receives the circuit, he asks Alice for the labels
corresponding to her input, and he uses a protocol called "1-of-2
oblivious transfer" to ask Alice for the labels corresponding to his own
input without revealing to Alice what his input is. He then goes through
the gates in the circuit one by one, uncovering the output wires of each
intermediate gate.</p>
<p>Suppose Alice's input is the two left wires and she gives (0, 1), and
Bob's input is the two right wires and he gives (1, 1). Here's the
circuit with labels again:</p>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/garbled/circuit2.png" class="padded" />
</center>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
<li>At the start, Bob knows the labels 6816, 3621, 4872, 5851</li>
<li>Bob evaluates the first gate. He knows 6816 and 4872, so he can
extract the output value corresponding to (1, 6816, 4872) (see the table
above) and extracts the first output bit, 1</li>
<li>Bob evaluates the second gate. He knows 6816 and 4872, so he can
extract the output value corresponding to (2, 6816, 4872) (see the table
above) and extracts the label 5990</li>
<li>Bob evaluates the third gate (XOR). He knows 3621 and 5851, and
learns 7504</li>
<li>Bob evaluates the fourth gate (OR). He knows 3621 and 5851, and
learns 6638</li>
<li>Bob evaluates the fifth gate (AND). He knows 3621 and 5851, and
learns 7684</li>
<li>Bob evaluates the sixth gate (XOR). He knows 5990 and 7504, and
learns the second output bit, 0</li>
<li>Bob evaluates the seventh gate (AND). He knows 5990 and 6638, and
learns 8674</li>
<li>Bob evaluates the eighth gate (OR). He knows 8674 and 7684, and
learns the third output bit, 1</li>
</ul>
<p>And so Bob learns the output: 101. And in binary 10 + 11 actually
equals 101 (the input and output bits are both given in
smallest-to-greatest order in the circuit, which is why Alice's input 10
is represented as (0, 1) in the circuit), so it worked!</p>
<p>Note that addition is a fairly pointless use of garbled circuits,
because Bob knowing 101 can just subtract out his own input and get 101
- 11 = 10 (Alice's input), breaking privacy. However, in general garbled
circuits can be used for computations that are not reversible, and so
don't break privacy in this way (eg. one might imagine a computation
where Alice's input and Bob's input are their answers to a personality
quiz, and the output is a single bit that determines whether or not the
algorithm thinks they are compatible; that one bit of information won't
let Alice or Bob know anything about each other's individual quiz
answers).</p>
<h3 id="of-2-oblivious-transfer">1 of 2 Oblivious Transfer</h3>
<p>Now let us talk more about 1-of-2 oblivious transfer, this technique
that Bob used to obtain the labels from Alice corresponding to his own
input. The problem is this. Focusing on Bob's first input bit (the
algorithm for the second input bit is the same), Alice has a label
corresponding to 0 (6529), and a label corresponding to 1 (4872). Bob
has his desired input bit: 1. Bob wants to learn the correct label
(4872) without letting Alice know that his input bit is 1. The trivial
solution (Alice just sends Bob both 6529 and 4872) doesn't work because
Alice only wants to give up one of the two input labels; if Bob receives
both input labels this could leak data that Alice doesn't want to give
up.</p>
<p>Here is <a
href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/notes/crypto/ot.html">a fairly
simple protocol</a> using elliptic curves:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Alice generates a random elliptic curve point, <code>H</code>.</li>
<li>Bob generates two points, <code>P1</code> and <code>P2</code>, with
the requirement that <code>P1 + P2</code> sums to <code>H</code>. Bob
chooses either <code>P1</code> or <code>P2</code> to be
<code>G * k</code> (ie. a point that he knows the corresponding private
key for). Note that the requirement that <code>P1 + P2 = H</code>
ensures that Bob has no way to generate <code>P1</code> and
<code>P2</code> such that he knows the corresponding private key for.
This is because if <code>P1 = G * k1</code> and <code>P2 = G * k2</code>
where Bob knows both <code>k1</code> and <code>k2</code>, then
<code>H = G * (k1 + k2)</code>, so that would imply Bob can extract the
discrete logarithm (or "corresponding private key") for <code>H</code>,
which would imply all of elliptic curve cryptography is broken.</li>
<li>Alice confirms <code>P1 + P2 = H</code>, and encrypts
<code>v1</code> under <code>P1</code> and <code>v2</code> under
<code>P2</code> using some standard public key encryption scheme (eg. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElGamal_encryption">El-Gamal</a>).
Bob is only able to decrypt one of the two values, because he knows the
private key corresponding to at most one of <code>(P1, P2)</code>, but
Alice does not know which one.</li>
</ol>
<p>This solves the problem; Bob learns one of the two wire labels
(either 6529 or 4872), depending on what his input bit is, and Alice
does not know which label Bob learned.</p>
<h3 id="applications">Applications</h3>
<p>Garbled circuits are potentially useful for many more things than
just 2-of-2 computation. For example, you can use them to make
multi-party computations of arbitrary complexity with an arbitrary
number of participants providing inputs, that can run in a constant
number of rounds of interaction. Generating a garbled circuit is
completely parallelizable; you don't need to finish garbling one gate
before you can start garbling gates that depend on it. Hence, you can
simply have a large multi-party computation with many participants
compute a garbling of all gates of a circuit and publish the labels
corresponding to their inputs. The labels themselves are random and so
reveal nothing about the inputs, but anyone can then execute the
published garbled circuit and learn the output "in the clear". See <a
href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/189.pdf">here</a> for a recent
example of an MPC protocol that uses garbling as an ingredient.</p>
<p>Multi-party computation is not the only context where this technique
of splitting up a computation into a parallelizable part that operates
on secret data followed by a sequential part that can be run in the
clear is useful, and garbled circuits are not the only technique for
accomplishing this. In general, the literature on <a
href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/385.pdf">randomized encodings</a>
includes many more sophisticated techniques. This branch of math is also
useful in technologies such as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_encryption">functional
encryption</a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indistinguishability_obfuscation">obfuscation</a>.</p>
