<p>One of the most powerful properties of a blockchain is the fact that
every single part of the blockchain's execution can be independently
validated. Even if a great majority of a blockchain's miners (or
validators in PoS) get taken over by an attacker, if that attacker tries
to push through invalid blocks, the network will simply reject them.
Even those users that were not verifying blocks at that time can be
(potentially automatically) warned by those who were, at which point
they can check that the attacker's chain is invalid, and automatically
reject it and coordinate on accepting a chain that follows the
rules.</p>
<p>But how much validation do we actually need? Do we need a hundred
independent validating nodes, a thousand? Do we need a culture where the
average person in the world runs software that checks every transaction?
It's these questions that are a challenge, and a very important
challenge to resolve especially if we want to build blockchains with
consensus mechanisms better than the single-chain "Nakamoto" proof of
work that the blockchain space originally started with.</p>
<h2 id="why-validate">Why validate?</h2>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/philosophy/badminer.png" class="padded" />
<br><br><small><i>A 51% attack pushing through an invalid block. We want
the network to reject the chain!</i></small>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>There are two main reasons why it's beneficial for a user to validate
the chain. First, it maximizes the chance that the node can correctly
determine and say on the <strong>canonical chain</strong> - the chain
that the community accepts as legitimate. Typically, the canonical chain
is defined as something like "the valid chain that has the most
miners/validators supporting it" (eg. the "longest valid chain" in
Bitcoin). Invalid chains are rejected by definition, and if there is a
choice between multiple valid chains, the chain that has the most
support from miners/validators wins out. And so if you have a node that
verifies all the validity conditions, and hence detects which chains are
valid and which chains are not, that maximizes your chances of correctly
detecting what the canonical chain actually is.</p>
<p>But there is also another deeper reason why validating the chain is
beneficial. Suppose that a powerful actor tries to push through a change
to the protocol (eg. changing the issuance), and has the support of the
majority of miners. If no one else validates the chain, this attack can
very easily succeed: everyone's clients will, <em>by default</em>,
accept the new chain, and by the time anyone sees what is going on, it
will be <em>up to the dissenters</em> to try to coordinate a rejection
of that chain. But if average users are validating, then the
coordination problem falls on the other side: it's now the
responsibility of whoever is trying to change the protocol to convince
the users to actively download the software patch to accept the protocol
change.</p>
<p>If enough users are validating, then <strong>instead of defaulting to
victory, a contentious attempt to force a change of the protocol will
default to chaos</strong>. Defaulting to chaos still causes a lot of
disruption, and would require out-of-band social coordination to
resolve, but it places a much larger barrier in front of the attacker,
and makes attackers much less confident that they will be able to get
away with a clean victory, making them much less motivated to even try
to start an attack. If <em>most</em> users are validating (directly or
indirectly), and an attack has <em>only</em> the support of the majority
of miners, then the attack will outright <strong>default to
failure</strong> - the best outcome of all.</p>
<h2 id="the-definition-view-versus-the-coordination-view">The definition
view versus the coordination view</h2>
<p>Note that this reasoning is very different from a different line of
reasoning that we often hear: that a chain that changes the rules is
somehow "by definition" not the correct chain, and that no matter how
many other users accept some new set of rules, what matters is that you
personally can stay on the chain with the old rules that you favor.</p>
<p>Here is one example of the "by definition" perspective <a
href="http://gavinandresen.ninja/a-definition-of-bitcoin">from Gavin
Andresen</a>:</p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/philosophy/definition_of_bitcoin.png"
class="padded" /></p>
<p>Here's another from <a
href="https://docs.wasabiwallet.io/using-wasabi/BitcoinFullNode.html#the-importance-of-running-a-full-node">the
Wasabi wallet</a>; this one comes even more directly from the
perspective of explaining why full nodes are valuable:</p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/philosophy/wasabi.png"
class="padded" /></p>
<p>Notice two core components of this view:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A version of the chain that does not accept the rules that you
consider fundamental and non-negotiable is <em>by definition</em> not
bitcoin (or not ethereum or whatever other chain), not matter how many
other people accept that chain.</li>
<li>What matters is that <em>you</em> remain on a chain that has rules
that <em>you</em> consider acceptable.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, I believe this "individualist" view to be very wrong. To see
why, let us take a look at the scenario that we are worried about: the
vast majority of participants accept some change to protocol rules that
you find unacceptable. For example, imagine a future where transaction
fees are very low, and to keep the chain secure, almost everyone else
agrees to change to a new set of rules that increases issuance. You
stubbornly keep running a node that continues to enforce the old rules,
and you fork off to a different chain than the majority.</p>
<p>From your point of view, you still have your coins in a system that
runs on rules that you accept. But so what? Other users will not accept
your coins. Exchanges will not accept your coins. Public websites may
show the price of the new coin as being some high value, but they're
referring to the coins on the majority chain; <em>your</em> coins are
valueless. Cryptocurrencies and blockchains are fundamentally social
constructs; without other people believing in them, they mean
nothing.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/philosophy/lonely.png"
class="padded" /></p>
<p>So what is the alternative view? The core idea is to look at
blockchains as <strong><a
href="../../../2017/05/08/coordination_problems.html">engineering
security through coordination problems</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Normally, coordination problems in the world are a bad thing: while
it would be better for most people if the English language got rid of
its highly complex and irregular spelling system and made a phonetic
one, or if the United States switched to metric, or if we could
immediately <a href="http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/6088.html">drop all
prices and wages by ten percent in the event of a recession</a>, in
practice this requires everyone to agree on the switch at the same time,
and this is often very very hard.</p>
<p>With blockchain applications, however, <em>we are using coordination
problems to our advantage</em>. We are using the friction that
coordination problems create as a bulwark against malfeasance by
centralized actors. We can build systems that have property X, and we
can guarantee that they will preserve property X because changing the
rules from X to not-X would require a whole bunch of people to agree to
update their software at the same time. Even if there is an actor that
could force the change, doing so would be hard - much much harder than
it would be if it were instead the responsibility of <em>users</em> to
actively coordinate dissent to resist a change.</p>
<p>Note one particular consequence of this view: it's emphatically
<em>not</em> the case that the purpose of your full node is just to
protect <em>you</em>, and in the case of a contentious hard fork, people
with full nodes are safe and people without full nodes are vulnerable.
Rather, the perspective here is much more one of <strong>herd
immunity</strong>: the more people are validating, the more safe
<em>everyone</em> is, and even if only some portion of people are
validating, everyone gets a high level of protection as a result.</p>
<h2 id="looking-deeper-into-validation">Looking deeper into
validation</h2>
<p>We now get to the next topic, and one that is very relevant to topics
such as light clients and sharding: what are we actually accomplishing
by validating? To understand this, let us go back to an earlier point.
If an attack happens, I would argue that we have the following
preference order over how the attack goes:</p>
<center>
<b>default to failure &gt; default to chaos &gt; default to victory</b>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>The "&gt;" here of course means "better than". The best is if an
attack outright fails; the second best is if an attack leads to
confusion, with everyone disagreeing on what the correct chain is, and
the worst is if an attack succeeds. Why is chaos so much better than
victory? This is a matter of incentives: chaos raises costs for the
attacker, and denies them the certainty that they will even win,
discouraging attacks from being attempted in the first place. A
default-to-chaos environment means that an attacker needs to win
<em>both</em> the blockchain war of making a 51% attack <em>and</em> the
"social war" of convincing the community to follow along. This is much
more difficult, and much less attractive, than just launching a 51%
attack and claiming victory right there.</p>
<p>The goal of validation is then to move away from default to victory
to (ideally) default to failure or (less ideally) default to chaos. If
you have a fully validating node, and an attacker tries to push through
a chain with different rules, then the attack fails. If some people have
a fully validating node but many others don't, the attack leads to
chaos. But now we can think: are there other ways of achieving the same
effect?</p>
<h3 id="light-clients-and-fraud-proofs">Light clients and fraud
proofs</h3>
<p>One natural advancement in this regard is <strong>light clients with
fraud proofs</strong>. Most blockchain light clients that exist today
work by simply validating that the majority of miners support a
particular block, and not bothering to check if the other protocol rules
are being enforced. The client runs on the trust assumption that the
majority of miners is honest. If a contentious fork happens, the client
follows the majority chain by default, and it's up to users to take an
active step if they want to follow the minority chain with the old
rules; hence, today's light clients under attack default to victory. But
with fraud proof technology, the situation starts to look very
different.</p>
<p>A fraud proof in its simplest form works as follows. Typically, a
single block in a blockchain only touches a small portion of the
blockchain "state" (account balances, smart contract code....). If a fully
verifying node processes a block and finds that it is invalid, they can
generate a package (the fraud proof) containing the block along with
just enough data from the blockchain state to process the block. They
broadcast this package to light clients. Light clients can then take the
package and use that data to verify the block themselves, even if they
have no other data from the chain.</p>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/philosophy/fraudproof.png"
class="padded" /> <br><i><small>A single block in a blockchain touches
only a few accounts. A fraud proof would contain the data in those
accounts along with Merkle proofs proving that that data is
correct.</small></i>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>This technique is also sometimes known as <em><a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/the-stateless-client-concept/172">stateless
validation</a></em>: instead of keeping a full database of the
blockchain state, clients can keep only the block headers, and they can
verify any block in real time by asking other nodes for a Merkle proof
for any desired state entries that block validation is accessing.</p>
<p>The power of this technique is that <strong>light clients can verify
individual blocks only if they hear an alarm</strong> (and alarms are
verifiable, so if a light client hears a false alarm, they can just stop
listening to alarms from that node). Hence, under normal circumstances,
the light client is still light, checking only which blocks are
supported by the majority of miners/validators. But under those
exceptional circumstances where the majority chain contains a block that
the light client would not accept, <strong>as long as there is at least
one honest node verifying the fraudulent block, that node will see that
it is invalid, broadcast a fraud proof, and thereby cause the rest of
the network to reject it</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="sharding">Sharding</h3>
<p>Sharding is a natural extension of this: in a sharded system, there
are too many transactions in the system for most people to be verifying
directly all the time, but if the system is well designed then any
individual invalid block can be detected and its invalidity proven with
a fraud proof, and that proof can be broadcasted across the entire
network. A sharded network can be summarized as <em>everyone</em> being
a light client. And as long as each shard has some minimum threshold
number of participants, the network has herd immunity.</p>
<p>In addition, the fact that in a sharded system block
<em>production</em> (and not just block <em>verification</em>) is highly
accessible and can be done even on consumer laptops is also very
important. The lack of dependence on high-performance hardware at the
core of the network ensures that there is a low bar on dissenting
minority chains being viable, making it even harder for a
majority-driven protocol change to "win by default" and bully everyone
else into submission.</p>
<p>This is what auditability usually means in the real world: not that
everyone is verifying everything all the time, but that (i) there are
enough eyes on each specific piece that if there is an error it will get
detected, and (ii) when an error is detected that fact that be made
clear and visible to all.</p>
<p>That said, in the long run blockchains can certainly improve on this.
One particular source of improvements is ZK-SNARKs (or "validity
proofs"): efficiently verifiably cryptographic proofs that allow block
producers to prove to clients that blocks satisfy some arbitrarily
complex validity conditions. <a
href="https://medium.com/starkware/validity-proofs-vs-fraud-proofs-4ef8b4d3d87a">Validity
proofs are stronger than fraud proofs</a> because they do not depend on
an interactive game to catch fraud. Another important technology is <a
href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.09044.pdf">data availability
checks</a>, which can protect against blocks whose data is not fully
published. Data availability checks do rely on a very conservative
assumption that there exists at least some small number of honest nodes
somewhere in the network continues to apply, though the good news is
that this minimum honesty threshold is low, and does not grow even if
there is a very large number of attackers.</p>
<h2 id="timing-and-51-attacks">Timing and 51% attacks</h2>
<p>Now, let us get to the most powerful consequence of the "default to
chaos" mindset: 51% attacks themselves. The current norm in many
communities is that if a 51% attack wins, then that 51% attack is
necessarily the valid chain. This norm is often stuck to quite strictly;
and a recent <a
href="https://blog.bitquery.io/attacker-stole-807k-etc-in-ethereum-classic-51-attack">51%
attack on Ethereum Classic</a> illustrated this quite well. The attacker
reverted more than 3000 blocks (stealing 807,260 ETC in a double-spend
in the process), which pushed the chain farther back in history than one
of the two ETC clients (OpenEthereum) was technically able to revert; as
a result, Geth nodes went with the attacker's chain but OpenEthereum
nodes stuck with the original chain.</p>
<p>We can say that the attack did in fact default to chaos, though this
was an accident and not a deliberate design decision of the ETC
community. Unfortunately, the community then elected to accept the
(longer) attack chain as canonical, a move <a
href="https://twitter.com/eth_classic/status/1289637659351031809">described
by the eth_classic twitter</a> as "following Proof of Work as intended".
Hence, <em>the community norms actively helped the attacker
win</em>.</p>
<p>But we could instead agree on a definition of the canonical chain
that works differently: particularly, imagine a rule that once a client
has accepted a block as part of the canonical chain, and that block has
more than 100 descendants, the client will from then on never accept a
chain that does not include that block. Alternatively, in a
finality-bearing proof of stake setup (which eg. ethereum 2.0 is),
imagine a rule that once a block is finalized it can never be
reverted.</p>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/philosophy/finalizer.png" class="padded" />
<br><br><small><i>5 block revert limit only for illustration purposes;
in reality the limit could be something longer like 100-1000
blocks.</i></small>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>To be clear, this introduces a significant change to how
canonicalness is determined: instead of clients just looking at the data
they receive by itself, clients also look at <em>when</em> that data was
received. This introduces the possibility that, because of network
latency, clients disagree: what if, because of a massive attack, two
conflicting blocks A and B finalize at the same time, and some clients
see A first and some see B first? But I would argue that this is good:
it means that <strong>instead of defaulting to victory, even 51% attacks
that just try to revert transactions default to chaos</strong>, and
out-of-band emergency response can choose which of the two blocks the
chain continues with. If the protocol is well-designed, forcing an
escalation to out-of-band emergency response should be very expensive:
in proof of stake, such a thing would require 1/3 of validators
sacrificing their deposits and getting slashed.</p>
<p>Potentially, we could expand this approach. We could try to <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/censorship-detectors-via-99-fault-tolerant-consensus/2878">make
51% attacks that censor transactions</a> default to chaos too. Research
on <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/timeliness-detectors-and-51-attack-recovery-in-blockchains/6925"><strong>timeliness
detectors</strong></a> pushes things further in the direction of attacks
of all types defaulting to failure, though a little chaos remains
because timeliness detectors cannot help nodes that are not
well-connected and online.</p>
<p><strong>For a blockchain community that values immutability,
implementing revert limits of this kind are arguably the superior path
to take</strong>. It is difficult to honestly claim that a blockchain is
immutable when no matter how long a transaction has been accepted in a
chain, there is always the possibility that some unexpected activity by
powerful actors can come along and revert it. Of course, I would claim
that even BTC and ETC do <em>already</em> have a revert limit at the
extremes; if there was an attack that reverted weeks of activity, the
community would likely adopt a user-activated soft fork to reject the
attackers' chain. But more definitively agreeing on and formalizing this
seems like a step forward.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There are a few "morals of the story" here. First, if we accept the
legitimacy of social coordination, and we accept the legitimacy of
indirect validation involving "1-of-N" trust models (that is, assuming
that there exists one honest person in the network somewhere; NOT the
same as assuming that one specific party, eg. Infura, is honest), then
we can create blockchains that are much more scalable.</p>
<p>Second, client-side validation is extremely important for all of this
to work. A network where only a few people run nodes and everyone else
really does trust them is a network that can easily be taken over by
special interests. But avoiding such a fate does <em>not</em> require
going to the opposite extreme and having everyone always validate
everything! Systems that allow each individual block to be verified in
isolation, so users only validate blocks if someone else raises an
alarm, are totally reasonable and serve the same effect. But this
requires accepting the "coordination view" of <em>what validation is
for</em>.</p>
<p>Third, if we allow the definition of canonicalness includes timing,
then we open many doors in improving our ability to reject 51% attacks.
The easiest property to gain is <a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/25/proof-stake-learned-love-weak-subjectivity/">weak
subjectivity</a>: the idea that if clients are required to log on at
least once every eg. 3 months, and refuse to revert longer than that,
then we can add slashing to proof of stake and make attacks very
expensive. But we can go further: we can reject chains that revert
finalized blocks and thereby protect immutability, and even protect
against censorship. Because the network is unpredictable, relying on
timing <em>does</em> imply attacks "defaulting to chaos" in some cases,
but the benefits are very much worth it.</p>
<p>With all of these ideas in mind, we can avoid the traps of (i)
over-centralization, (ii) overly redundant verification leading to
inefficiency <em>and</em> (iii) misguided norms accidentally making
attacks easier, and better work toward building more resilient,
performant and secure blockchains.</p>
