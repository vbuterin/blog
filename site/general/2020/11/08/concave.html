<title> Convex and Concave Dispositions </title>

<p>One of the major philosophical differences that I have noticed in how
people approach making large-scale decisions in the world is how they
approach the age-old tradeoff of compromise versus purity. Given a
choice between two alternatives, often both expressed as deep principled
philosophies, do you naturally gravitate toward the idea that one of the
two paths should be correct and we should stick to it, or do you prefer
to find a way in the middle between the two extremes?</p>
<p>In mathematical terms, we can rephrase this as follows: do you expect
the world that we are living in, and in particular the way that it
responds to the actions that we take, to fundamentally be <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concave_function"><strong>concave</strong></a>
or <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_function"><strong>convex</strong></a>?</p>
<br>

<p><br><br></p>
<p>Someone with a concave disposition might say things like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Going to the extremes has never been good for us; you can die from
being too hot or too cold. We need to find the balance between the two
that's just right"</li>
<li>"If you implement only a little bit of a philosophy, you can pick
the parts that have the highest benefits and the lowest risks, and avoid
the parts that are more risky. But if you insist on going to the
extremes, once you've picked the low-hanging fruit, you'll be forced to
look harder and harder for smaller and smaller benefits, and before you
know it the growing risks might outweigh the benefit of the whole
thing"</li>
<li>"The opposing philosophy probably has some value too, so we should
try to combine the best parts of both, and definitely avoid doing things
that the opposing philosophy considers to be <em>extremely</em>
terrible, just in case"</li>
</ul>
<p>Someone with a convex disposition might say things like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>"We need to focus. Otherwise, we risk becoming a jack of all trades,
master of none"</li>
<li>"If we take even a few steps down that road, it will become slippery
slope and only pull us down ever further until we end up in the abyss.
There's only two stable positions on the slope: either we're down there,
or we stay up here"</li>
<li>"If you give an inch, they will take a mile"</li>
<li>"Whether we're following this philosophy or that philosophy, we
should be following <em>some</em> philosophy and just stick to it.
Making a wishy-washy mix of everything doesn't make sense"</li>
</ul>
<p>I personally find myself perenially more sympathetic to the concave
approach than the convex approach, across a wide variety of contexts. If
I had to choose either (i) a coin-flip between anarcho-capitalism and
Soviet communism or (ii) a 50/50 compromise between the two, I would
pick the latter in a heartbeat. I <a
href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1277758769351589891">argued
for moderation</a> in Bitcoin block size debates, arguing against both
1-2 MB small blocks <a
href="https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1032248504603828224">and
128 MB "very big blocks"</a>. I've <a
href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/910550101940039680">argued
against</a> the idea that freedom and decentralization are "you either
have it or you don't" properties with no middle ground. I <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4oj7ql/personal_statement_regarding_the_fork/">argued</a>
in <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4ro2p9/options_in_the_hard_fork_slockit_blog/d52oizp/">favor</a>
of the DAO fork, but to many people's surprise I've argued since then
against similar "state-intervention" hard forks that were proposed more
recently. As I <a
href="https://twitter.com/_sgtn/status/1089462282977824768">said in
2019</a>, "support for Szabo's law [blockchain immutability] is a
spectrum, not a binary".</p>
<p>But as you can probably tell by the fact that I needed to make those
statements at all, not everyone seems to share the same broad intuition.
<strong>I would particularly argue that the Ethereum ecosystem in
general has a fundamentally concave temperament, while the Bitcoin
ecosystem's temperament is much more fundamentally convex</strong>. In
Bitcoin land, you can frequently hear arguments that, for example, <a
href="https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1106308069800185874">either
you have self-sovereignty or you don't</a>, or that any system must have
either a <a
href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/sharding-centralizes-ethereum-by-selling-you-scaling-in-disguised-as-scaling-out-266c136fc55d">fundamentally
centralizing or a fundamentally decentralizing tendency</a>, with no
possibility halfway in between.</p>
<p>The occasional half-joking <a
href="https://azcoinnews.com/udi-wertheimer-tron-will-surpass-ethereum-in-the-battle-for-decentralized-supremacy-in-2020.html">support
for Tron</a> is a key example: from my own concave point of view, if you
value decentralization and immutability, you should recognize that while
the Ethereum ecosystem does sometimes violate purist conceptions of
these values, Tron violates them far more egregiously and without
remorse, and so Ethereum is still by far the more palatable of the two
options. But from a convex point of view, the extremeness of Tron's
violations of these norms is a virtue: while Ethereum half-heartedly
pretends to be decentralized, Tron is centralized <em>but at least it's
proud and honest about it</em>.</p>
<p>This difference between concave and convex mindsets is not at all
limited to arcane points about efficiency/decentralization tradeoffs in
cryptocurrencies. It applies to politics (guess which side has more
outright anarcho-capitalists), other choices in technology, and even
what food you eat.</p>

<p><br><br></p>
<p>But in all of these questions too, I personally find myself fairly
consistently coming out on the side of balance.</p>
<h2 id="being-concave-about-concavity">Being concave about
concavity</h2>
<p>But it's worth noting that <a
href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/09/12/in-the-balance/">even on the
meta-level</a>, concave temperament is something that one must take
great care to avoid being extreme about. There are certainly situations
where policy A gives a good result, policy B gives a worse but still
tolerable result, but a half-hearted mix between the two is worst of
all. The coronavirus is perhaps an excellent example: a 100% effective
travel ban is <a
href="https://mobile.twitter.com/lymanstoneky/status/1321254322064236544">far
more than twice as useful</a> as a 50% effective travel ban. An
effective lockdown that pushes the R0 of the virus down below 1 can
eradicate the virus, leading to a quick recovery, but a half-hearted
lockdown that only pushes the R0 down to 1.3 leads to months of agony
with little to show for it. This is one possible explanation for why
many Western countries responded poorly to it: political systems
designed for compromise risk falling into middle approaches even when
they are not effective.</p>
<p>Another example is a war: if you invade country A, you conquer
country A, if you invade country B, you conquer country B, but if you
invade both at the same time sending half your soldiers to each one, the
power of the two combined will crush you. In general, problems where the
effect of a response is convex are often places where you can find
benefits of some degree of centralization.</p>
<p>But there are also many places where a mix is clearly better than
either extreme. A common example is the question of setting tax rates.
In economics there is the general principle that <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadweight_loss">deadweight loss is
quadratic</a>: that is, the harms from the inefficiency of a tax are
proportional <em>to the square</em> of the tax rate. The reason why this
is the case can be seen as follows. A tax rate of 2% deters very few
transactions, and even the transactions it deters are not very valuable
- how valuable can a transaction be if a mere 2% tax is enough to
discourage the participants from making it? A tax rate of 20% would
deter perhaps ten times more transactions, but <em>each individual
transaction that was deterred is itself ten times more valuable to its
participants</em> than in the 2% case. Hence, a 10x higher tax may cause
100x higher economic harm. And for this reason, a low tax is generally
better than a coin flip between high tax and no tax.</p>
<p>By similar economic logic, an outright prohibition on some behavior
may cause more than twice as much harm as a tax set high enough to only
deter half of people from participating. Replacing existing prohibitions
with medium-high punitive taxes (a very concave-temperamental thing to
do) could increase efficiency, increase freedom <em>and</em> provide
valuable revenue to build public goods or help the impoverished.</p>
<p>Another example of effects like this in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve">Laffer curve</a>: a
tax rate of zero raises no revenue, a tax rate of 100% raises no revenue
because no one bothers to work, but some tax rate in the middle raises
the most revenue. There are debates about what that revenue-maximizing
rate is, but in general there's broad agreement that the chart looks
something like this:</p>
<br>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/convex-files/laffer.png" />
</center>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>If you had to pick either the average of two proposed tax plans, or a
coin-flip between them, it's obvious that the average is usually best.
And taxes are not the only phenomenon that are like this; economics
studies a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns">wide array of
"diminishing returns" phenomena</a> which occur everywhere in
production, consumption and many other aspects of regular day-to-day
behavior. Finally, a common flip-side of diminishing returns is
accelerating costs: to give one notable example, if you take <a
href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerkay/2013/08/05/how-the-marginal-utility-of-money-balances-with-value/">standard
economic models of utility of money</a>, they directly imply that double
the economic inequality can cause four times the harm.</p>
<h2 id="the-world-has-more-than-one-dimension">The world has more than
one dimension</h2>
<p>Another point of complexity is that in the real world, policies are
not just single-dimensional numbers. There are many ways to average
between two different policies, or two different philosophies. One easy
example to see this is: suppose that you and your friend want to live
together, but you want to live in Toronto and your friend wants to live
in New York. How would you compromise between these two options?</p>
<p>Well, you could take the geographic compromise, and enjoy your
peaceful existence at the arithmetic midpoint between the two lovely
cities at....</p>
<br>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/convex-files/streetmap2.png" /><br><br>This
Assembly of God church about 29km southwest of Ithaca, NY.
</center>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>Or you could be even more mathematically pure, and take the
straight-line midpoint between Toronto and New York without even
bothering to stay on the Earth's surface. Then, you're still pretty
close to that church, but you're six kilometers under it. A different
way to compromise is spending six months every year in Toronto and six
months in New York - and this may well be an actually reasonable path
for some people to take.</p>
<p>The point is, when the options being presented to you are more
complicated than simple single-dimensional numbers, figuring out
<em>how</em> to compromise between the options well, and really take the
best parts of both and not the worst parts of both, is an art, and a
challenging one.</p>
<p>And this is to be expected: "convex" and "concave" are terms best
suited to mathematical functions where the input and the output are both
one-dimensional. The real world is high-dimensional - and as
machine-learning researchers have <a
href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/11/theoretical-deep-learning.html">now
well established</a>, in high-dimensional environments the most common
setting that you can expect to find yourself in is not a universally
convex or universally concave one, but rather a <em>saddle point</em>: a
point where the local region is convex in some directions but concave in
other directions.</p>
<br>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/convex-files/saddlepoint.png" class="padded" /><br><br>A
saddle point. Convex left-to-right, concave forward-to-backward.
</center>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>This is probably the best mathematical explanation for why both of
these dispositions are to some extent necessary: the world is not
entirely convex, but it is not entirely concave either. But the
existence of <em>some</em> concave path between any two distant
positions A and B is very likely, and if you can find that path then you
can often find a synthesis between the two positions that is better than
both.</p>
