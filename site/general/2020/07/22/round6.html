<title> Gitcoin Grants Round 6 Retrospective </title>

<p>Round 6 of Gitcoin Grants has just finished, with $227,847 in
contributions from 1,526 contributors and $175,000 in matched funds
distributed across 695 projects. This time around, we had three
categories: the two usual categories of "tech" and "community" (the
latter renamed from "media" to reflect a desire for a broad emphasis),
and the round-6-special category Crypto For Black Lives.</p>
<p>First of all, here are the results, starting with the tech and
community sections:</p>

<h3 id="stability-of-income">Stability of income</h3>
<p>In the last round, one <a
href="../../../2020/04/30/round5.html">concern I raised</a> was
stability of income. People trying to earn a livelihood off of quadratic
funding grants would want to have some guarantee that their income isn't
going to completely disappear in the next round just because the hive
mind suddenly gets excited about something else.</p>
<p>Round 6 had two mechanisms to try to provide more stability of
income:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A "shopping cart" interface for giving many contributions, with an
explicit "repeat your contributions from the last round" feature</li>
<li>A rule that the matching amounts are calculated using not just
contributions from this round, but also "carrying over" 1/3 of the
contributions from the previous round (ie. if you made a $10 grant in
the previous round, the matching formula would pretend you made a $10
grant in the previous round and also a $3.33 grant this round)</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li>was clearly successful at one goal: increasing the total number of
contributions. But its effect in ensuring stability of income is hard to
measure. The effect of (2), on the other hand, is easy to measure,
because we have stats for the actual matching amount as well as what the
matching amount "would have been" if the 1/3 carry-over rule was not in
place.</li>
</ol>
<p>First from the tech category:</p>

</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now from the community category:</p>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/round6/communitytable.png" />
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Clearly, the rule helps reduce volatility, pretty much exactly as
expected. That said, one could argue that this result is trivial: you
could argue that all that's going on here is something very similar to
grabbing part of the revenue from round N (eg. see how the new EIP-1559
Community Fund earned less than it otherwise would have) and moving it
into round N+1. Sure, numerically speaking the revenues are more
"stable", but individual projects could have just provided this
stability to themselves by only spending 2/3 of the pot from each round,
and using the remaining third later when some future round is
unexpectedly low. Why should the quadratic funding mechanism
significantly increase its complexity just to achieve a gain in
stability that projects could simply provide for themselves?</p>
<p>My instinct says that it would be best to try the next round with the
"repeat last round" feature but <em>without</em> the 1/3 carryover, and
see what happens. Particularly, note that the numbers seem to show that
the media section would have been "stable enough" even without the
carryover. The tech section was more volatile, but only because of the
sudden entrance of the EIP 1559 community fund; it would be part of the
experiment to see just how common that kind of situation is.</p>
<h3 id="about-that-eip-1559-community-fund">About that EIP 1559
Community fund...</h3>
<p>The big unexpected winner of this round was the EIP 1559 community
fund. EIP 1559 (EIP <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1559">here</a>, FAQ <a
href="https://notes.ethereum.org/Wjr1SnW-QaST7phX9C5wkg?view">here</a>,
original paper <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/draft-position-paper-on-resource-pricing/2838">here</a>)
is a major fee market reform proposal which far-reaching consequences;
it aims to improve the user experience of sending Ethereum transactions,
reduce economic inefficiencies, provide an accurate in-protocol gas
price oracle and burn a portion of fee revenue.</p>
<p>Many people in the Ethereum community are very excited about this
proposal, though so far there has been fairly little funding toward
getting it implemented. This gitcoin grant was a large community effort
toward fixing this.</p>
<p>The grant had quite a few very large contributions, including roughly
$2,400 each from myself and Eric Conner, early on. Early in the round,
one could clearly see the EIP 1559 community grant having an abnormally
low ratio of matched funds to contributed funds; it was somewhere around
$4k matched to $20k contributed. This was because while the amount
contributed was large, it came from relatively few wealthier donors, and
so the matching amount was less than it would have been had the same
quantity of funds come from more diverse sources - the quadratic funding
formula working as intended. However, a social media push advertising
the grant then led to a large number of smaller contributors following
along, which then quickly raised the match to its currently very high
value ($35,578).</p>
<h3 id="quadratic-signaling">Quadratic signaling</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, this grant proved to have a double function. First, it
provided $65,473 of much-needed funding to EIP 1559 implementation.
Second, it served as a credible community signal of the level of demand
for the proposal. The Ethereum community has <a
href="../../../2017/12/17/voting.html">long been struggling</a> to find
effective ways to determine what "the community" supports, especially in
cases of controversy.</p>
<p>Coin votes have been <a
href="https://www.etherchain.org/coinvote">used in the past</a>, and
have the advantage that they come with an answer to the key problem of
determining who is a "real community member" - the answer is, your
membership in the Ethereum community is proportional to how much ETH you
have. However, they are plutocratic; in the famous DAO coin vote, a
single "yes" voter voted with more ETH than all "no" voters put together
(~20% of the total).</p>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/round6/daocoinvote.png" style="width:350px" />
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>The alternative, looking at github, reddit and twitter comments and
votes to measure sentiment (sometimes derided as "proof of social
media") is egalitarian, but it is easily exploitable, comes with no
skin-in-the-game, and frequently falls under criticisms of "foreign
interference" (are those <em>really</em> ethereum community members
disagreeing with the proposal, or just those dastardly bitcoiners coming
in from across the pond to stir up trouble?).</p>
<p>Quadratic funding falls perfectly in the middle: the need to
contribute monetary value to vote ensures that the votes of those who
<em>really</em> care about the project count more than the votes of
less-concerned outsiders, and the square-root function ensures that the
votes of individual ultra-wealthy "whales" cannot beat out a poorer, but
broader, coalition.</p>

<img src="../../../../images/round6/quadraticpayments.png" style="width:600px" class="padded" /><br><br><small><i>A
diagram from my <a href="../../../2019/12/07/quadratic.html">post on
quadratic payments</a> showing how quadratic payments is "in the middle"
between the extremes of voting-like systems and money-like systems, and
avoids the worst flaws of both.</i></small>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>This raises the question: might it make sense to try to use explicit
quadratic <em>voting</em> (with the ability to vote "yes" or "no" to a
proposal) as an additional signaling tool to determine community
sentiment for ethereum protocol proposals?</p>
<h3 id="how-well-are-guest-categories-working">How well are "guest
categories" working?</h3>
<p>Since round 5, Gitcoin Grants has had three categories per round:
tech, community (called "media" before), and some "guest" category that
appears only during that specific round. In round 5 this was COVID
relief; in round 6, it's Crypto For Black Lives.</p>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/round6/blacklives.jpg" style="width:350px" />
</center>
<p>By far the largest recipient was Black Girls CODE, claiming over 80%
of the matching pot. My guess for why this happened is simple: Black
Girls CODE is an established project that has been participating in the
grants for several rounds already, whereas the other projects were new
entrants that few people in the Ethereum community knew well. In
addition, of course, the Ethereum community "understands" the value of
helping people code more than it understands chambers of commerce and
bail funds.</p>
<p>This raises the question: is Gitcoin's current approach of having a
guest category each round actually working well? The case for "no" is
basically this: while the individual causes (empowering black
communities, and fighting covid) are certainly admirable, the Ethereum
community is by and large not experts at these topics, and we're
certainly not experts on <em>those specific projects</em> working on
those challenges.</p>
<p>If the goal is to try to bring quadratic funding to causes beyond
Ethereum, the natural alternative is a separate funding round marketed
specifically to those communities; <a
href="https://downtownstimulus.com/">https://downtownstimulus.com/</a>
is a great example of this. If the goal is to get the Ethereum community
interested in other causes, then perhaps running more than one round on
each cause would work better. For example, "guest categories" could last
for three rounds (~6 months), with $8,333 matching per round (and there
could be two or three guest categories running simultaneously). In any
case, it seems like some revision of the model makes sense.</p>
<h3 id="collusion">Collusion</h3>
<p>Now, the bad news. This round saw an unprecedented amount of
attempted collusion and other forms of fraud. Here are a few of the most
egregious examples.</p>
<p>Blatant attempted bribery:</p>
<center>
<br>
<img src="../../../../images/round6/pic1.jpeg" style="width:480px"/><br>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Impersonation:</p>
<center>
<br>
<img src="../../../../images/round6/pic2.png" style="width:480px"/><br>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Many contributions with funds clearly coming from a single
address:</p>
<center>
<br>
<img src="../../../../images/round6/pic3.png" style="width:480px" /><br>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>The big question is: how much fraudulent activity can be prevented in
a fully automated/technological way, without requiring detailed analysis
of each and every case? If quadratic funding cannot survive such fraud
without needing to resort to expensive case-by-case judgement, then
regardless of its virtues in an ideal world, in reality it would not be
a very good mechanism!</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is a lot that we can do to reduce harmful
collusion and fraud that we are not yet doing. Stronger identity systems
is one example; in this round, Gitcoin added optional SMS verification,
and it seems like the in this round the detected instances of collusion
were mostly github-verified accounts and not SMS-verified accounts. In
the next round, making some form of extra verification beyond a github
account (whether SMS or something more decentralized, eg. BrightID)
seems like a good idea. To limit bribery, <a
href="https://github.com/appliedzkp/maci">MACI</a> can help, by making
it impossible for a briber to tell who actually voted for any particular
project.</p>
<p>Impersonation is not really a quadratic funding-specific challenge;
this could be solved with manual verification, or if one wishes for a
more decentralized solution one could try using <a
href="https://kleros.io/">Kleros</a> or some similar system. One could
even imagine incentivized reporting: anyone can lay down a deposit and
flag a project as fraudulent, triggering an investigation; if the
project turns out to be legitimate the deposit is lost but if the
project turns out to be fraudulent, the challenger gets half of the
funds that were sent to that project.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The best news is the unmentioned news: many of the positive behaviors
coming out of the quadratic funding rounds have stabilized. We're seeing
valuable projects get funded in the tech and community categories, there
has been less social media contention this round than in previous
rounds, and people are getting better and better at understanding the
mechanism and how to participate in it.</p>
<p>That said, the mechanism is definitely at a scale where we are seeing
the kinds of attacks and challenges that we would realistically see in a
larger-scale context. There are some challenges that we have not yet
worked through (one that I am particularly watching out for is: matched
grants going to a project that one part of the community supports and
another part of the community thinks is very harmful). That said, we've
gotten as far as we have with fewer problems than even I had been
anticipating.</p>
<p>I recommend holding steady, focusing on security (and scalability)
for the next few rounds, and coming up with ways to increase the size of
the matching pots. And I continue to look forward to seeing valuable
public goods get funded!</p>
