<p><a
href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/plasma/">Plasma</a>
is a class of blockchain scaling solutions that allow all data and
computation, except for deposits, withdrawals and Merkle roots, to be
kept off-chain. This opens the door to very large scalability gains that
are not bottlenecked by on-chain data availability. Plasma was <a
href="http://plasma.io/plasma-deprecated.pdf">first invented in
2017</a>, and saw many iterations in 2018, most notably <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-viable-plasma/426">Minimal Viable
Plasma</a>, <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/plasma-cash-plasma-with-much-less-per-user-data-checking/1298">Plasma
Cash</a>, <a
href="https://hackmd.io/DgzmJIRjSzCYvl4lUjZXNQ?view#%F0%9F%9A%AA-Exit">Plasma
Cashflow</a> and <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/plasma-prime-design-proposal/4222">Plasma
Prime</a>. Unfortunately, Plasma has since largely been superseded by <a
href="../../../2021/01/05/rollup.html">rollups</a>, for reasons
primarily having to do with (i) large client-side data storage costs,
and (ii) fundamental limitations of Plasma that make it <a
href="https://medium.com/@kelvinfichter/why-is-evm-on-plasma-hard-bf2d99c48df7">hard
to generalize beyond payments</a>.</p>
<p>The advent of validity proofs (aka <a
href="../../../2021/01/26/snarks.html">ZK-SNARKs</a>) gives us a reason
to rethink this decision. The largest challenge of making Plasma work
for payments, client-side data storage, can be efficiently addressed
with validity proofs. Additionally, validity proofs provide a wide array
of tools that allow us to make a Plasma-like chain that runs an EVM. The
Plasma security guarantees would not cover all users, as the fundamental
reasons behind the impossibility of extending Plasma-style exit games to
many kinds of complex applications still remain. However, a very large
percentage of assets could nevertheless be kept secure in practice.</p>
<p>This post describes how Plasma ideas can be extended to do such a
thing.</p>
<h2 id="overview-how-plasma-works">Overview: how Plasma works</h2>
<p>The simplest version of Plasma to understand is Plasma Cash. Plasma
Cash works by treating each individual coin as a separate NFT, and
tracking a separate history for each coin. A Plasma chain has an
<em>operator</em>, who is responsible for making and regularly
publishing blocks. The transactions in each block are stored as a sparse
Merkle tree: if a transaction transfers ownership of coin
<code>k</code>, it appears in position <code>k</code> of the tree. When
the Plasma chain operator creates a new block, they publish the root of
the Merkle tree to chain, and they directly send to each user the Merkle
branches corresponding to the coins that that user owns.</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/neoplasma/plasmacash.png" /></p>
<p><em>Suppose that these are the last three transaction trees in a
Plasma Cash chain. Then, assuming all previous trees are valid, we know
that Eve currently owns coin 1, David owns coin 4 and George owns coin
6.</em></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>The main risk in any Plasma system is the operator misbehaving. This
can happen in two ways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Publishing an <strong>invalid block</strong> (eg. the operator
includes a transaction sending coin 1 from Fred to Hermione even if Fred
doesn't own the coin at that time)</li>
<li>Publishing an <strong>unavailable block</strong> (eg. the operator
does not send Bob his Merkle branch for one of the blocks, preventing
him from ever proving to someone else that his coin is still valid and
unspent)</li>
</ol>
<p>If the operator misbehaves in a way that is relevant to a user's
assets, the user has the responsibility to exit immediately
(specifically, within 7 days). When a user ("<strong>the
exiter</strong>") exits, they provide a Merkle branch proving the
inclusion of the transaction that transferred that coin from <strong>the
previous owner</strong> to them. This starts a 7-day <strong>challenge
period</strong>, during which others can challenge that exit by
providing a Merkle proof of one of three things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Not latest owner</strong>: a later transaction signed by the
exiter transferring the exiter's coin to someone else</li>
<li><strong>Double spend</strong>: a transaction that transferred the
coin from the previous owner to someone else, that was included before
the transaction transferring the coin to the exiter</li>
<li><strong>Invalid history</strong>: a transaction that transferred the
coins before (within the past 7 days) that does not have a corresponding
spend. The exiter can respond by providing the corresponding spend; if
they do not, the exit fails.</li>
</ol>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/neoplasma/challengetypes.png" /></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>With these rules, anyone who owns coin <code>k</code> needs to see
all of the Merkle branches of position <code>k</code> in all historical
trees for the past week to be sure that they actually own coin
<code>k</code> and can exit it. They need to store all the branches
containing transfers of the asset, so that they can respond to
challenges and safely exit with their coin.</p>
<h3 id="generalizing-to-fungible-tokens">Generalizing to fungible
tokens</h3>
<p>The above design works for NFTs. However, much more common than NFTs
are fungible tokens, like ETH and USDC. One way to apply Plasma Cash to
fungible tokens is to simply make each small denomination of a coin (eg.
0.01 ETH) a separate NFT. Unfortunately, the gas costs of exiting would
be too high if we do this.</p>
<p>One solution is to optimize by treating many adjacent coins as a
single unit, which can be transferred or exited all at once. There are
two ways to do this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Use Plasma Cash almost as-is, but use fancy algorithms to compute
the Merkle tree of a really large number of objects very quickly if many
adjacent objects are the same. This is surprisingly not that hard to do;
you can see a <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/research/blob/master/proof_of_solvency/crazy_merkle_tree.py">python
implementation here</a>.</li>
<li>Use <a
href="https://hackmd.io/DgzmJIRjSzCYvl4lUjZXNQ?view#%F0%9F%9A%AA-Exit">Plasma
Cashflow</a>, which simply represents many adjacent coins as a single
object.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, both of these approaches run into the problem of
<em>fragmentation</em>: if you receive 0.001 ETH each from hundreds of
people who are buying coffees from you, you are going to have 0.001 ETH
in many places in the tree, and so actually exiting that ETH would still
require submitting many separate exits, making the gas fees prohibitive.
Defragmentation protocols have been developed, but are tricky to
implement.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we can redesign the system to take into account a more
traditional <a
href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/glossary/unspent-transaction-output-utxo">"unspent
transaction output" (UTXO) model</a>. When you exit a coin, you would
need to provide the last week of history of those coins, and anyone
could challenge your exit by proving that those historical coins were
already exited.</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/neoplasma/utxo.png" /></p>
<p><small></p>
<p><em>A withdrawal of the 0.2 ETH UTXO at the bottom right could be
cancelled by showing a withdrawal of any of the UTXOs in its history,
shown in green. Particularly note that the middle-left and bottom-left
UTXOs are ancestors, but the top-left UTXO is not. This approach is
similar to <a
href="https://github.com/killerstorm/colored-coin-tools/blob/master/colors.md">order-based
coloring</a> ideas from colored coins protocols circa 2013.</em></p>
</small>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>There is a wide variety of techniques for doing this. In all cases,
the goal is to track some conception of what is "the same coin" at
different points in history, in order to prevent "the same coin" from
being withdrawn twice.</p>
<h3 id="challenges-with-generalizing-to-evm">Challenges with
generalizing to EVM</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, generalizing beyond payments to the EVM is much
harder. One key challenge is that many state objects in the EVM do not
have a clear "owner". Plasma's security depends on each object having an
owner, who has the responsibility to watch and make sure the chain's
data is available, and exit that object if anything goes wrong. Many
Ethereum applications, however, do not work this way. Uniswap liquidity
pools, for example, do not have a single owner.</p>
<p>Another challenge is that the EVM does not attempt to limit
dependencies. ETH held in account A at block N could have come from
anywhere in block N-1. In order to exit a consistent state, an EVM
Plasma chain would need to have an exit game where, in the extreme case,
someone wishing to exit using information from block N might need to pay
the fees to publish the <em>entire</em> block N state on chain: a gas
cost in the many millions of dollars. UTXO-based Plasma schemes do not
have this problem: each user can exit their assets from whichever block
is the most recent block that they have the data for.</p>
<p>A third challenge is that the unbounded dependencies in the EVM make
it much harder to have aligned incentives to prove <em>validity</em>.
The validity of any state depends on everything else, and so proving any
one thing requires proving everything. Sorting out failures in such a
situation generally cannot be made incentive-compatible due to the <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/research/wiki/A-note-on-data-availability-and-erasure-coding">data
availability problem</a>. A particularly annoying problem is that we
lose the guarantee, present in UTXO-based systems, that an object's
state cannot change without its owner's consent. This guarantee is
incredibly useful, as it means that the owner is always aware of the
latest provable state of their assets, and simplifies exit games.
Without it, creating exit games becomes much harder.</p>
<h2 id="how-validity-proofs-can-alleviate-many-of-these-problems">How
validity proofs can alleviate many of these problems</h2>
<p>The most basic thing that validity proofs can do to improve Plasma
chain designs is to prove the validity of each Plasma block on chain.
This <em>greatly</em> simplifies the design space: it means that the
only attack from the operator that we have to worry about is
<em>unavailable</em> blocks, and not <em>invalid</em> blocks. In Plasma
Cash, for example, it removes the need to worry about history
challenges. This reduces the state that a user needs to download, from
one branch per block in the last week, to one branch per asset.</p>
<p>Additionally, withdrawals from the most recent state (in the common
case where the operator is honest, all withdrawals would be from the
most recent state) are not subject to not-latest-owner challenges, and
so in a validity-proven Plasma chain such withdrawals would not be
subject to any challenges at all. This means that, <strong>in the normal
case, withdrawals can be instant!</strong></p>
<h3 id="extending-to-the-evm-parallel-utxo-graphs">Extending to the EVM:
parallel UTXO graphs</h3>
<p>In the EVM case, validity proofs also let us do something clever:
they can be used to implement a parallel UTXO graph for ETH and ERC20
tokens, and <em>SNARK-prove equivalence between the UTXO graph and the
EVM state</em>. Once you have that, you could implement a "regular"
Plasma system over the UTXO graph.</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/neoplasma/evmutxo.png" /></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>This lets us sidestep many of the complexities of the EVM. For
example, the fact that in an account-based system someone can edit your
account without your consent (by sending it coins and thereby increasing
its balance) does not matter, because the Plasma construction is not
over the EVM state itself, but rather over a UTXO state that lives in
parallel to the EVM, where any coins that you receive would be separate
objects.</p>
<h3 id="extending-to-the-evm-total-state-exiting">Extending to the EVM:
total state exiting</h3>
<p>There have been simpler schemes proposed to make a "plasma EVM", eg.
<a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/plasma-free/16570">Plasma Free</a> and
before that <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-fully-generalized-s-ark-based-plasma/5580">this
post from 2019</a>. In these schemes, anyone can send a message on the
L1 to force the operator to either include a transaction or make a
particular branch of the state available. If the operator fails to do
this, the chain starts reverting blocks. The chain <em>stops</em>
reverting once someone posts a full copy of either the whole state, or
at least all of the data that users have flagged as being potentially
missing. Making a withdrawal can require posting a bounty, which would
pay for that user's share of the gas costs of someone posting such a
large amount of data.</p>
<p>Schemes like this have the weakness that they do not allow instant
withdrawals in the normal case, because there is always the possibility
that the chain will need to revert the latest state.</p>
<h2 id="limits-of-evm-plasma-schemes">Limits of EVM plasma schemes</h2>
<p><strong>Schemes like this are powerful, but are NOT able to provide
full security guarantees to all users</strong>. The case where they
break down most clearly is situations where a particular state object
does not have a clear economic "owner".</p>
<p>Let us consider the case of a CDP (collateralized debt position), a
smart contract where a user has coins that are locked up and can only be
released once the user pays their debt. Suppose that user has 1 ETH
(~$2000 as of the time of this writing) locked up in a CDP with 1000 DAI
of debt. Now, the Plasma chain stops publishing blocks, and the user
refuses to exit. The user could simply never exit. Now, the user has a
<em>free option</em>: if the price of ETH drops below $1000, they walk
away and forget about the CDP, and if the price of ETH stays above,
eventually they claim it. On average, such a malicious user earns money
from doing this.</p>
<p>Another example is a privacy system, eg. Tornado Cash or <a
href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4563364">Privacy
Pools</a>. Consider a privacy system with five depositors:</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/neoplasma/privacy.png" /></p>
<p><small></p>
<p><em>The ZK-SNARKs in the privacy system keep the link between the
owner of a coin coming into the system and the owner of the coin coming
out hidden.</em></p>
</small>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Suppose that only orange has withdrawn, and at that point the Plasma
chain operator stops publishing data. Suppose also that we use the UTXO
graph approach with a first-in-first-out rule, so each coin gets matched
to the coin right below it. Then, orange could withdraw their pre-mixed
<em>and</em> post-mixed coin, and the system would perceive it as two
separate coins. If blue tries to withdraw their pre-mixed coin, orange's
more recent state would supersede it; meanwhile, blue would not have the
information to withdraw their post-mixed coin.</p>
<p>This <em>can</em> be fixed if you allow the other four depositors to
withdraw the privacy contract itself (which would supersede the
deposits), and then take the coins out on L1. However, actually
implementing such a mechanism requires additional effort on the part of
people developing the privacy system.</p>
<p>There are also other ways to solve privacy, eg. the <a
href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1082.pdf">Intmax</a> approach, which
involves putting a few bytes on chain rollup-style together with a
Plasma-like operator that passes around information between individual
users.</p>
<p>Uniswap LP positions have a similar problem: if you traded USDC for
ETH in a Uniswap position, you could try to withdraw your pre-trade USDC
<em>and</em> your post-trade ETH. If you collude with the Plasma chain
operator, the liquidity providers and other users would not have access
to the post-trade state, so they would not be able to withdraw their
post-trade USDC. Special logic would be required to prevent situations
like this.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>In 2023, Plasma is an underrated design space. Rollups remain the
gold standard, and have security properties that cannot be matched. This
is particularly true from the developer experience perspective: nothing
can match the simplicity of an application developer <em>not even having
to think</em> about ownership graphs and incentive flows within their
application.</p>
<p>However, Plasma lets us completely sidestep the data availability
question, greatly reducing transaction fees. Plasma can be a significant
security <em>upgrade</em> for chains that would otherwise be validiums.
The fact that <a href="../../../2022/08/04/zkevm.html">ZK-EVMs are
finally coming to fruition</a> this year makes it an excellent
opportunity to re-explore this design space, and come up with even more
effective constructions to simplify the developer experience and protect
users' funds.</p>
