<title> What do I think about biometric proof of personhood? </title>

<p><em>Special thanks to the Worldcoin team, the Proof of Humanity
community and Andrew Miller for discussion.</em></p>
<p>One of the trickier, but potentially one of the most valuable,
gadgets that people in the Ethereum community have been trying to build
is a decentralized proof-of-personhood solution. <a
href="https://berkeley-defi.github.io/assets/material/Proof%20of%20Person.pdf">Proof
of personhood</a>, aka the "<a
href="../../../2019/11/22/progress.html#numberfifteensic">unique-human
problem</a>", is a limited form of real-world identity that asserts that
a given registered account is controlled by a real person (and a
different real person from every other registered account), ideally
without revealing <em>which</em> real person it is.</p>
<p>There have been a few efforts at tackling this problem: <a
href="https://proofofhumanity.id/">Proof of Humanity</a>, <a
href="https://www.brightid.org/">BrightID</a>, <a
href="https://www.idena.io/">Idena</a> and <a
href="https://circles.garden/">Circles</a> come up as examples. Some of
them come with their own applications (often a UBI token), and some have
found use in <a href="https://passport.gitcoin.co">Gitcoin Passport</a>
to verify which accounts are valid for quadratic voting. Zero-knowledge
tech like <a href="https://sismo.io/">Sismo</a> adds privacy to many of
these solutions. More recently, we have seen the rise of a much larger
and more ambitious proof-of-personhood project: <a
href="https://whitepaper.worldcoin.org/">Worldcoin</a>.</p>
<p>Worldcoin was co-founded by Sam Altman, who is best known for being
the CEO of OpenAI. The <a
href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/engineering/humanness-in-the-age-of-ai">philosophy
behind the project</a> is simple: AI is going to create a lot of
abundance and wealth for humanity, but it also may kill very many
people's <a
href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/chatgpt-sam-altman-artificial-intelligence-openai-b0e1c8c9">jobs</a>
and make it almost impossible to tell who even is a human and not a bot,
and so we need to plug that hole by (i) creating a really good
proof-of-personhood system so that humans can prove that they actually
are humans, and (ii) giving everyone a UBI. Worldcoin is unique in that
it relies on highly sophisticated biometrics, scanning each user's <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(anatomy)">iris</a> using a
piece of specialized hardware called "the Orb":</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/biometric/orb.png" /></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>The goal is to produce a large number of these Orbs and widely
distribute them around the world and put them <a
href="https://twitter.com/mh1/status/1674075646190919683">in public
places</a> to make it easy for anyone to get an ID. To Worldcoin's
credit, they have also <a
href="https://whitepaper.worldcoin.org/decentralization-and-open-sourcing">committed</a>
to decentralize over time. At first, this means technical
decentralization: being an L2 on Ethereum using <a
href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/worldcoin-commits-optimism-superchain-vision-ahead-mainnet-launch">the
Optimism stack</a>, and protecting users' privacy with <a
href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/worldcoin/solving-for-privacy-worldcoin-approach-keeping-information-safe">ZK-SNARKs
and other cryptographic techniques</a>. Later on, it includes
decentralizing governance of the system itself.</p>
<p>Worldcoin has been criticized for privacy and security concerns
around the Orb, design issues in its "coin", and for <a
href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/06/1048981/worldcoin-cryptocurrency-biometrics-web3/">ethical
issues</a> around some <a
href="https://twitter.com/resistancemoney/status/1677260312951816193">choices</a>
that the company has made. Some of the criticisms are highly specific,
focusing on decisions made by the project that could easily have been
made in another way - and indeed, that the Worldcoin project itself may
be willing to change. Others, however, raise the more fundamental
concern of whether or not biometrics - not just the eye-scanning
biometrics of Worldcoin, but also the simpler face-video-uploads and
verification games used in Proof of Humanity and Idena - are a good idea
at all. And still others <a
href="https://twitter.com/lakshmansankar/status/1682660621966245888">criticize
proof of personhood in general</a>. Risks include unavoidable privacy
leaks, further erosion of people's ability to navigate the internet
anonymously, coercion by authoritarian governments, and the potential
impossibility of being secure at the same time as being
decentralized.</p>

<p>This post will talk about these issues, and go through some arguments
that can help you decide whether or not bowing down and scanning your
eyes (or face, or voice, or...) before our new spherical overlords is a
good idea, and whether or not the natural alternatives - either using
social-graph-based proof of personhood or giving up on proof of
personhood entirely - are any better.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-proof-of-personhood-and-why-is-it-important">What is
proof of personhood and why is it important?</h2>
<p>The simplest way to define a proof-of-personhood system is: it
creates a list of public keys where the system guarantees that each key
is controlled by a unique human. In other words, if you're a human, you
can put one key on the list, but you can't put two keys on the list, and
if you're a bot you can't put any keys on the list.</p>
<p>Proof of personhood is valuable because it solves a lot of anti-spam
and anti-concentration-of-power problems that many people have, in a way
that avoids dependence on centralized authorities and reveals the
minimal information possible. If proof of personhood is not solved,
decentralized governance (including "micro-governance" like votes on
social media posts) <a href="../../../2021/08/16/voting3.html">becomes
much easier</a> to <a
href="../../../2018/03/28/plutocracy.html">capture</a> by <a
href="../../../2021/09/26/limits.html">very wealthy actors</a>,
including hostile governments. Many services would only be able to
prevent denial-of-service attacks by setting a price for access, and
sometimes a price high enough to keep out attackers is also too high for
many lower-income legitimate users.</p>
<p>Many major applications in the world today deal with this issue by
using government-backed identity systems such as credit cards and
passports. This solves the problem, but it makes large and perhaps
unacceptable sacrifices on privacy, and can be trivially attacked by
governments themselves.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>In many proof-of-personhood projects - not just Worldcoin, but also
Proof of Humanity, Circles and others - the "flagship application" is a
built-in "N-per-person token" (sometimes called a "UBI token"). Each
user registered in the system receives some fixed quantity of tokens
each day (or hour, or week). But there are plenty of other
applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Airdrops for token distributions</li>
<li>Token or NFT sales that <a
href="../../../2021/08/22/prices.html">give more favorable terms to
less-wealthy users</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../2021/08/16/voting3.html">Voting in DAOs</a></li>
<li>A way to "seed" graph-based reputation systems</li>
<li><a href="../../../2019/12/07/quadratic.html">Quadratic voting</a>
(and funding, and attention payments)</li>
<li>Protection against bots / <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack">sybil attacks</a> in
social media</li>
<li>An alternative to captchas for preventing <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">DoS
attacks</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In many of these cases, the common thread is a desire to create
mechanisms that are open and democratic, avoiding both centralized
control by a project's operators and domination by its wealthiest users.
The latter is <a href="../../../2021/08/16/voting3.html">especially
important in decentralized governance</a>. In many of these cases,
existing solutions today rely on some combination of (i) highly opaque
AI algorithms that leave lots of room to undetectably discriminate
against users that the operators simply do not like, and (ii)
centralized IDs, aka "KYC". An effective proof-of-personhood solution
would be a much better alternative, achieving the security properties
that those applications need without the pitfalls of the existing
centralized approaches.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-some-early-attempts-at-proof-of-personhood">What are
some early attempts at proof of personhood?</h2>
<p>There are two main forms of proof of personhood:
<strong>social-graph-based</strong> and <strong>biometric</strong>.
Social-graph based proof of personhood relies on some form of vouching:
if Alice, Bob, Charlie and David are all verified humans, and they all
say that Emily is a verified human, then Emily is probably also a
verified human. Vouching is often enhanced with incentives: if Alice
says that Emily is a human, but it turns out that she is not, then Alice
and Emily may both get penalized. Biometric proof of personhood involves
verifying some physical or behavioral trait of Emily, that distinguishes
humans from bots (and individual humans from each other). Most projects
use a combination of the two techniques.</p>
<p>The four systems I mentioned at the beginning of the post work
roughly as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://proofofhumanity.id/">Proof of
Humanity</a></strong>: you upload a video of yourself, and provide a
deposit. To be approved, an existing user needs to vouch for you, and an
amount of time needs to pass during which you can be challenged. If
there is a challenge, a <a href="https://kleros.io/about/">Kleros
decentralized court</a> determines whether or not your video was
genuine; if it is not, you lose your deposit and the challenger gets a
reward.</li>
<li><strong><a
href="https://brightid.gitbook.io/brightid/getting-verified">BrightID</a></strong>:
you join a video call "verification party" with other users, where
everyone verifies each other. Higher levels of verification are
available via <a
href="https://medium.com/brightid/what-is-markaz-verification-level-47397372c8eb">Bitu</a>,
a system in which you can get verified if enough other Bitu-verified
users vouch for you.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://idena.network/">Idena</a></strong>: you play
a captcha game at a specific point in time (to prevent people from
participating multiple times); part of the captcha game involves
creating and verifying captchas that will then be used to verify
others.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://circles.garden">Circles</a></strong>: an
existing Circles user vouches for you. Circles is unique in that it does
not attempt to create a "globally verifiable ID"; rather, it creates a
graph of trust relationships, where someone's trustworthiness can only
be verified from the perspective of your own position in that
graph.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-does-worldcoin-work">How does Worldcoin work?</h2>
<p>Each Worldcoin user installs an app on their phone, which generates a
private and public key, much like an Ethereum wallet. They then go
in-person to visit an "Orb". The user stares into the Orb's camera, and
at the same time shows the Orb a QR code generated by their Worldcoin
app, which contains their public key. The Orb scans the user's eyes, and
uses complicated hardware scanning and machine-learned classifiers to
verify that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The user is a real human</li>
<li>The user's iris does not match the iris of any other user that has
previously used the system</li>
</ol>
<p>If both scans pass, the Orb signs a message approving a specialized
hash of the user's iris scan. The hash gets uploaded to a database -
currently a centralized server, intended to be replaced with a
decentralized on-chain system once they are sure the hashing mechanism
works. The system does not store full iris scans; it only stores hashes,
and these hashes are used to check for uniqueness. From that point
forward, the user has a "<a href="https://worldcoin.org/world-id">World
ID</a>".</p>
<p>A World ID holder is able to prove that they are a unique human by
generating a ZK-SNARK proving that they hold the private key
corresponding to a public key in the database, without revealing
<em>which</em> key they hold. Hence, even if someone re-scans your iris,
they will not be able to see any actions that you have taken.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-major-issues-with-worldcoins-construction">What are
the major issues with Worldcoin's construction?</h2>
<p>There are four major risks that immediately come to mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong>. The registry of iris scans may reveal
information. At the very least, if <em>someone else</em> scans your
iris, they can check it against the database to determine whether or not
you have a World ID. Potentially, iris scans might reveal more
information.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility</strong>. World IDs are not going to be
reliably accessible unless there are so many Orbs that anyone in the
world can easily get to one.</li>
<li><strong>Centralization</strong>. The Orb is a hardware device, and
we have no way to verify that it was constructed correctly and does not
have backdoors. Hence, even if the software layer is perfect and fully
decentralized, the Worldcoin Foundation still has the ability to insert
a backdoor into the system, letting it create arbitrarily many fake
human identities.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>. Users' phones could be hacked, users
could be coerced into scanning their irises while showing a public key
that belongs to someone else, and there is the possibility of
3D-printing "fake people" that can pass the iris scan and get World
IDs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>It's important to distinguish between (i) issues specific to
choices made by Worldcoin, (ii) issues that <em>any biometric proof of
personhood</em> will inevitably have, and (iii) issues that <em>any
proof of personhood in general</em> will have.</strong> For example,
signing up to Proof of Humanity means publishing your face on the
internet. Joining a BrightID verification party doesn't <em>quite</em>
do that, but still exposes who you are to a lot of people. And joining
Circles publicly exposes your social graph. Worldcoin is significantly
<em>better</em> at preserving privacy than either of those. On the other
hand, Worldcoin depends on specialized hardware, which opens up the
challenge of trusting the orb manufacturers to have constructed the orbs
correctly - a challenge which has no parallels in Proof of Humanity,
BrightID or Circles. It's even conceivable that in the future, someone
other than Worldcoin will create a <em>different</em>
specialized-hardware solution that has different tradeoffs.</p>
<h2
id="how-do-biometric-proof-of-personhood-schemes-address-privacy-issues">How
do biometric proof-of-personhood schemes address privacy issues?</h2>
<p>The most obvious, and greatest, potential privacy leak that any
proof-of-personhood system has is linking each action that a person
takes to a real-world identity. This data leak is very large, arguably
unacceptably large, but fortunately it is easy to solve with <strong><a
href="../../../2022/06/15/using_snarks.html">zero knowledge
proof</a></strong> technology. Instead of directly making a signature
with a private key whose corresponding public key is in the database, a
user could make a ZK-SNARK proving that they own the private key whose
corresponding public key is <em>somewhere</em> in the database, without
revealing which specific key they have. This can be done generically
with tools like <a href="https://www.sismo.io/">Sismo</a> (see <a
href="https://app.sismo.io/proof-of-humanity">here</a> for the Proof of
Humanity-specific implementation), and Worldcoin has its own built-in
implementation. <strong>It's important to give "crypto-native" proof of
personhood credit here: they actually care about taking this basic step
to provide anonymization, whereas basically all centralized identity
solutions do not.</strong></p>
<p>A more subtle, but still important, privacy leak is the mere
<em>existence</em> of a public registry of biometric scans. In the case
of Proof of Humanity, this is a lot of data: you get a video of each
Proof of Humanity participant, making it very clear to anyone in the
world who cares to investigate who all the Proof of Humanity
participants are. <a
href="https://whitepaper.worldcoin.org/technical-implementation#privacy">In
the case of Worldcoin</a>, the leak is much more limited: the Orb
locally computes and publishes only a "hash" of each person's <a
href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/worldcoin/iris-biometrics-optic-id-world-id">iris
scan</a>. This hash is not a regular hash like SHA256; rather, it is a
specialized algorithm based on machine-learned <a
href="https://whitepaper.worldcoin.org/technical-implementation#iris-feature-generation-with-gabor-wavelets-2">Gabor
filters</a> that <a
href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/engineering/iris-recognition-inference-system">deals
with the inexactness</a> inherent in any biometric scan, and ensures
that successive hashes taken of the same person's iris have similar
outputs.</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/biometric/match_chart.png" /></p>
<p><small><i></p>
<p>Blue: percent of bits that differ between two scans of the same
person's iris. Orange: percent of bits that differ between two scans of
two different people's irises.</p>
</i></small>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>These iris hashes leak only a small amount of data. If an adversary
can forcibly (or secretly) scan your iris, then they can compute your
iris hash themselves, and check it against the database of iris hashes
to see whether or not you participated in the system. This ability to
check whether or not someone signed up is necessary for the system
itself to prevent people from signing up multiple times, but there's
always the possibility that it will somehow be abused. Additionally,
there is the possibility that the iris hashes leak some amount of
medical data (sex, ethnicity, perhaps medical conditions), but this leak
is far smaller than what could be captured by pretty much any other mass
data-gathering system in use today (eg. even street cameras). On the
whole, to me the privacy of storing iris hashes seems sufficient.</p>
<p>If others disagree with this judgement and decide that they want to
design a system with even more privacy, there are two ways to do so:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If the iris hashing algorithm can be improved to make the difference
between two scans of the same person much lower (eg. reliably under 10%
bit flips), then instead of storing full iris hashes, the system can
store a smaller number of error correction bits for iris hashes (see: <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_extractor">fuzzy
extractors</a>). If the difference between two scans is under 10%, then
the number of bits that needs to be published would be at least 5x
less.</li>
<li>If we want to go further, we could store the iris hash database
inside a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation">multi-party
computation (MPC)</a> system which could only be accessed by Orbs (with
a rate limit), making the data unaccessible entirely, but at the cost of
significant protocol complexity and social complexity in governing the
set of MPC participants. This would have the benefit that users would
not be able to prove a link between two different World IDs that they
had at different times even if they wanted to.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, these techniques are not applicable to Proof of
Humanity, because Proof of Humanity requires the full video of each
participant to be publicly available so that it can be challenged if
there are signs that it is fake (including AI-generated fakes), and in
such cases investigated in more detail.</p>
<p>On the whole, despite the "dystopian vibez" of staring into an Orb
and letting it scan deeply into your eyeballs, it does seem like
specialized hardware systems can do quite a decent job of protecting
privacy. However, the flip side of this is that specialized hardware
systems introduce much greater centralization concerns. Hence, we
cypherpunks seem to be stuck in a bind: we have to trade off one
deeply-held cypherpunk value against another.</p>
<h2
id="what-are-the-accessibility-issues-in-biometric-proof-of-personhood-systems">What
are the accessibility issues in biometric proof-of-personhood
systems?</h2>
<p>Specialized hardware introduces accessibility concerns because, well,
specialized hardware is not very accessible. Somewhere between <a
href="https://www.ecofinagency.com/telecom/0203-44312-ssa-report-expects-smartphone-adoption-to-grow-to-87-in-2030">51%</a>
and <a
href="https://furtherafrica.com/2022/07/19/african-countries-with-the-highest-number-of-mobile-phones/">64%</a>
of sub-Saharan Africans now have smartphones, and this seems to be
projected to <a

to 87%</a> by 2030. But while there are billions of smartphones, there
are only a few hundred Orbs. Even with much higher-scale distributed
manufacturing, it would be hard to get to a world where there's an Orb
within five kilometers of <em>everyone</em>.</p>

</i></small>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is also worth noting that many <em>other</em> forms of proof of
personhood have accessibility problems that are even worse. It is very
difficult to join a social-graph-based proof-of-personhood system unless
you already know someone who is in the social graph. This makes it very
easy for such systems to remain restricted to a single community in a
single country.</p>
<p>Even <em>centralized</em> identity systems have learned this lesson:
India's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aadhaar">Aadhaar ID

href="https://dbtbharat.gov.in/static-page-content/spagecont?id=18">huge
cost savings</a>), though of course the Aadhaar system as a whole is far
weaker on privacy than anything being proposed on a large scale within
the crypto community.</p>
<p><strong>The best-performing systems from an accessibility perspective
are actually systems like Proof of Humanity</strong>, which you can sign
up to using only a smartphone - though, as we have seen and as we will
see, such systems come with all kinds of other tradeoffs.</p>
<h2
id="what-are-the-centralization-issues-in-biometric-proof-of-personhood-systems">What
are the centralization issues in biometric proof-of-personhood
systems?</h2>
<p>There are three:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Centralization risks in the system's top-level governance (esp. the
system that makes final top-level resolutions if different actors in the
system disagree on subjective judgements).</li>
<li>Centralization risks unique to systems that use specialized
hardware.</li>
<li>Centralization risks if proprietary algorithms are used to determine
who is an authentic participant.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any proof-of-personhood system must contend with (1), perhaps with
the exception of systems where the set of "accepted" IDs is completely
subjective. If a system uses incentives denominated in outside assets
(eg. ETH, USDC, DAI), then it cannot be fully subjective, and so
governance risks become unavoidable.</p>
<p>[2] is a much bigger risk for Worldcoin than for Proof of Humanity
(or BrightID), because Worldcoin depends on specialized hardware and
other systems do not.</p>
<p>[3] is a risk particularly in "<a
href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274">logically
centralized</a>" systems where there is a single system doing the
verification, unless all of the algorithms are open-source and we have
an assurance that they are actually running the code that they claim
they are. For systems that rely purely on users verifying other users
(like Proof of Humanity), it is not a risk.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-worldcoin-address-hardware-centralization-issues">How
does Worldcoin address hardware centralization issues?</h3>
<p>Currently, a Worldcoin-affiliated entity called <a
href="https://www.toolsforhumanity.com/">Tools for Humanity</a> is the
only organization that is making Orbs. However, the Orb's source code is
<a
href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/engineering/opening-orb-look-inside-worldcoin-biometric-imaging-device">mostly
public</a>: you can see the hardware specs in <a
href="https://github.com/worldcoin/orb-hardware">this github
repository</a>, and other parts of the source code are expected to be
published soon. The <a
href="https://github.com/worldcoin/orb-hardware/blob/main/LICENSE.md">license</a>
is another one of those "shared source but not technically open source
until four years from now" licenses similar to the <a
href="https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core/blob/main/LICENSE">Uniswap
BSL</a>, except in addition to preventing forking it also prevents what
they consider unethical behavior - they specifically list mass
surveillance and <a
href="https://www.un.org/en/universaldeclaration-human-rights/">three</a>
international <a
href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx">civil</a>
rights <a
href="https://www.ilo.org/declaration/thedeclaration/textdeclaration/lang--en/index.htm">declarations</a>.</p>
<p>The team's stated goal is to allow and encourage other organizations
to create Orbs, and over time transition from Orbs being created by
Tools for Humanity to having some kind of DAO that approves and manages
which organizations can make Orbs that are recognized by the system.</p>
<p>There are two ways in which this design can fail:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>It fails to actually decentralize</strong>. This could
happen because of the common <a
href="https://fieldnotes.resistant.tech/federation-is-the-worst-of-all-worlds/">trap
of federated protocols</a>: one manufacturer ends up dominating in
practice, causing the system to re-centralize. Presumably, governance
could limit how many valid Orbs each manufacturer can produce, but this
would need to be managed carefully, and it puts a lot of pressure on
governance to be both decentralized <em>and</em> monitor the ecosystem
and respond to threats effectively: a much harder task than eg. a fairly
static DAO that just handles top-level dispute resolution tasks.</li>
<li><strong>It turns out that it's not possible to make such a
distributed manufacturing mechanism secure</strong>. Here, there are two
risks that I see:
<ul>
<li><strong>Fragility against bad Orb manufacturers</strong>: if even
one Orb manufacturer is malicious or hacked, it can generate an
unlimited number of fake iris scan hashes, and give them World IDs.</li>
<li><strong>Government restriction of Orbs</strong>: governments that do
not want their citizens participating in the Worldcoin ecosystem can ban
Orbs from their country. Furthermore, they could even force their
citizens to get their irises scanned, allowing the government to get
their accounts, and the citizens would have no way to respond.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>To make the system more robust against bad Orb manufacturers, the
Worldcoin team is proposing to perform regular audits on Orbs, verifying
that they are built correctly and key hardware components were built
according to specs and were not tampered with after the fact. This is a
challenging task: it's basically something like the <a
href="https://www.iaea.org/publications/factsheets/iaea-safeguards-overview">IAEA
nuclear inspections bureaucracy</a> but for Orbs. The hope is that even
a very imperfect implementation of an auditing regime could greatly cut
down on the number of fake Orbs.</p>
<p>To limit the harm caused by any bad Orb that <em>does</em> slip
through, it makes sense to have a second mitigation. <strong>World IDs
registered with different Orb manufacturers, and ideally with different
Orbs, should be distinguishable from each other</strong>. It's okay if
this information is private and only stored on the World ID holder's
device; but it does need to be provable on demand. This makes it
possible for the ecosystem to respond to (inevitable) attacks by
removing individual Orb manufacturers, and perhaps even individual Orbs,
from the whitelist on-demand. If we see the North Korea government going
around and forcing people to scan their eyeballs, those Orbs and any
accounts produced by them could be immediately retroactively
disabled.</p>
<h2 id="security-issues-in-proof-of-personhood-in-general">Security
issues in proof of personhood in general</h2>
<p>In addition to issues specific to Worldcoin, there are concerns that
affect proof-of-personhood designs in general. The major ones that I can
think of are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>3D-printed fake people</strong>: one could use AI to
generate photographs or even 3D prints of fake people that are
convincing enough to get accepted by the Orb software. If even one group
does this, they can generate an unlimited number of identities.</li>
<li><strong>Possibility of selling IDs</strong>: someone can provide
someone else's public key instead of their own when registering, giving
that person control of their registered ID, in exchange for money. This
<a
href="https://twitter.com/resistancemoney/status/1677259644321005568">seems
to be happening already</a>. In addition to selling, there's also the
possibility of <strong>renting IDs</strong> to use for a short time in
one application.</li>
<li><strong>Phone hacking</strong>: if a person's phone gets hacked, the
hacker can steal the key that controls their World ID.</li>
<li><strong>Government coercion to steal IDs</strong>: a government
could force their citizens to get verified while showing a QR code
belonging to the government. In this way, a malicious government could
gain access to millions of IDs. In a biometric system, this could even
be done covertly: governments could use obfuscated Orbs to extract World
IDs from everyone entering their country at the passport control
booth.</li>
</ol>
<p>[1] is specific to biometric proof-of-personhood systems. [2] and [3]
are common to both biometric and non-biometric designs. [4] is also
common to both, though the techniques that are required would be quite
different in both cases; in this section I will focus on the issues in
the biometric case.</p>
<p>These are pretty serious weaknesses. Some already have been addressed
in existing protocols, others can be addressed with future improvements,
and still others seem to be fundamental limitations.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-we-deal-with-fake-people">How can we deal with fake
people?</h3>
<p>This is significantly less of a risk for Worldcoin than it is for
Proof of Humanity-like systems: an in-person scan can examine many
features of a person, and is quite hard to fake, compared to merely <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/25/european-leaders-deepfake-video-calls-mayor-of-kyiv-vitali-klitschko">deep-faking</a>
a <a
href="https://twitter.com/TheRundownAI/status/1637517438685159424?s=20">video</a>.
Specialized hardware is inherently harder to fool than commodity
hardware, which is in turn harder to fool than digital algorithms
verifying pictures and videos that are sent remotely.</p>
<p>Could someone 3D-print something that can fool even specialized
hardware eventually? Probably. I expect that at some point we will see
growing tensions between the goal of keeping the mechanism open and
keeping it secure: open-source AI algorithms are inherently more
vulnerable to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversarial_machine_learning">adversarial
machine learning</a>. Black-box algorithms are more protected, but it's
hard to tell that a black-box algorithm was not trained to include
backdoors. Perhaps <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhXTdU_SpBE">ZK-ML
technologies</a> could give us the best of both worlds. Though at some
point in the even further future, it is likely that even the best AI
algorithms will be fooled by the best 3D-printed fake people.</p>
<p>However, from my discussions with both the Worldcoin and Proof of
Humanity teams, it seems like at the present moment neither protocol is
yet seeing significant deep fake attacks, for the simple reason that
<strong>hiring real low-wage workers to sign up on your behalf is quite
cheap and easy</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="can-we-prevent-selling-ids">Can we prevent selling IDs?</h3>
<p>In the short term, preventing this kind of outsourcing is difficult,
because most people in the world are not even aware of
proof-of-personhood protocols, and if you tell them to hold up a QR code
and scan their eyes for $30 they will do that. Once more people
<em>are</em> aware of what proof-of-personhood protocols are, a fairly
simple mitigation becomes possible: <strong>allowing people who have a
registered ID to re-register, canceling the previous ID</strong>. This
makes "ID selling" much less credible, because someone who sells you
their ID can just go and re-register, canceling the ID that they just
sold. However, getting to this point requires the protocol to be
<em>very</em> widely known, and Orbs to be <em>very</em> widely
accessible to make on-demand registration practical.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why having a UBI coin integrated into a
proof-of-personhood system is valuable: <strong>a UBI coin provides an
easily understandable incentive for people to (i) learn about the
protocol and sign up, and (ii) immediately re-register if they register
on behalf of someone else</strong>. Re-registration also prevents phone
hacking.</p>
<h3
id="can-we-prevent-coercion-in-biometric-proof-of-personhood-systems">Can
we prevent coercion in biometric proof-of-personhood systems?</h3>
<p>This depends on what kind of coercion we are talking about. Possible
forms of coercion include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Governments scanning people's eyes (or faces, or...) at border control
and other routine government checkpoints, and using this to register
(and frequently re-register) their citizens</li>
<li>Governments banning Orbs within the country to prevent people from
independently re-registering</li>
<li>Individuals buying IDs and then threatening to harm the seller if
they detect that the ID has been invalidated due to re-registration</li>
<li>(Possibly government-run) applications requiring people to "sign in"
by signing with their public key directly, letting them see the
corresponding biometric scan, and hence the link between the user's
current ID and any future IDs they get from re-registering. A common
fear is that this makes it too easy to create "permanent records" that
stick with a person for their entire life.</li>
</ul>

<p><br></p>
<p>Especially in the hands of unsophisticated users, <strong>it seems
quite tough to outright prevent these situations</strong>. Users could
leave their country to (re-)register at an Orb in a safer country, but
this is a difficult process and high cost. In a truly hostile legal
environment, seeking out an independent Orb seems too difficult and
risky.</p>
<p><strong>What <em>is</em> feasible is making this kind of abuse more
<em>annoying to implement</em> and <em>detectable</em></strong>. The
Proof of Humanity approach of requiring a person to speak a specific
phrase when registering is a good example: it may be enough to prevent
<em>hidden</em> scanning, requiring coercion to be much more blatant,
and the registration phrase could even include a statement confirming
that the respondent knows that they have the right to re-register
independently and may get UBI coin or other rewards. If coercion is
detected, the devices used to perform coercive registrations en masse
could have their access rights revoked. To prevent applications linking
people's current and previous IDs and attempting to leave "permanent
records", the default proof of personhood app could lock the user's key
in trusted hardware, preventing any application from using the key
directly without the anonymizing ZK-SNARK layer in between. If a
government or application developer wants to get around this, they would
need to mandate the use of their own custom app.</p>
<p>With a combination of these techniques and active vigilance, locking
out those regimes that are truly hostile, and keeping honest those
regimes that are merely medium-bad (as much of the world is), seems
possible. This can be done either by a project like Worldcoin or Proof
of Humanity maintaining its own bureaucracy for this task, or by
revealing more information about how an ID was registered (eg. in
Worldcoin, which Orb it came from), and leaving this classification task
to the community.</p>
<h3 id="can-we-prevent-renting-ids-eg.-to-sell-votes">Can we prevent
<em>renting</em> IDs (eg. to sell votes)?</h3>
<p><em>Renting</em> out your ID is not prevented by re-registration.
This is okay in some applications: the cost of renting out your right to
collect the day's share of UBI coin is going to be just the value of the
day's share of UBI coin. But in applications such as voting, <a
href="../../../2021/09/26/limits.html">easy vote selling</a> is a huge
problem.</p>
<p>Systems like <a
href="https://privacy-scaling-explorations.github.io/maci/">MACI</a> can
prevent you from credibly selling your vote, by allowing you to later
cast another vote that invalidates your previous vote, in such a way
that no one can tell whether or not you in fact cast such a vote.
However, if the briber controls which key you get <em>at registration
time</em>, this does not help.</p>
<p>I see two solutions here:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Run entire applications inside an MPC</strong>. This would
also cover the re-registration process: when a person registers to the
MPC, the MPC assigns them an ID that is separate from, and not linkable
to, their proof of personhood ID, and when a person re-registers, only
the MPC would know which account to deactivate. This prevents users from
making proofs about their actions, because every important step is done
inside an MPC using private information that is only known to the
MPC.</li>
<li><strong>Decentralized registration ceremonies</strong>. Basically,
implement something like <a href="../../../2019/10/01/story.html">this
in-person key-registration protocol</a> that requires four randomly
selected local participants to work together to register someone. This
could ensure that registration is a "trusted" procedure that an attacker
cannot snoop in during.</li>
</ol>
<p>Social-graph-based systems may actually perform better here, because
they can create local decentralized registration processes automatically
as a byproduct of how they work.</p>
<h2
id="how-do-biometrics-compare-with-the-other-leading-candidate-for-proof-of-personhood-social-graph-based-verification">How
do biometrics compare with the other leading candidate for proof of
personhood, social graph-based verification?</h2>
<p>Aside from biometric approaches, the main other contender for proof
of personhood so far has been social-graph-based verification.
Social-graph-based verification systems all operate on the same
principle: if there are a whole bunch of existing verified identities
that all attest to the validity of your identity, then you probably are
valid and should also get verified status.</p>

<p>Proponents of social-graph-based verification often describe it as
being a better alternative to biometrics for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It <strong>does not rely on special-purpose hardware</strong>,
making it much easier to deploy</li>
<li>It <strong>avoids a permanent arms race</strong> between
manufacturers trying to create fake people and the Orb needing to be
updated to reject such fake people</li>
<li>It <strong>does not require collecting biometric data</strong>,
making it more privacy-friendly</li>
<li>It is <strong>potentially more friendly to pseudonymity</strong>,
because if someone chooses to split their internet life across multiple
identities that they keep separate from each other, both of those
identities could potentially be verified (but maintaining multiple
genuine and separate identities sacrifices network effects and has a
high cost, so it's not something that attackers could do easily)</li>
<li><strong>Biometric approaches give a binary score</strong> of "is a
human" or "is not a human", which is fragile: people who are
accidentally rejected would end up with no UBI at all, and potentially
no ability to participate in online life. <strong>Social-graph-based
approaches can give a more nuanced numerical score</strong>, which may
of course be moderately unfair to some participants but is unlikely to
"un-person" someone completely.</li>
</ul>
<p>My perspective on these arguments is that I largely agree with them!
These are genuine advantages of social-graph-based approaches and should
be taken seriously. However, it's worth also taking into account the
weaknesses of social-graph-based approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bootstrapping</strong>: for a user to join a
social-graph-based system, that user must know someone who is already in
the graph. This makes large-scale adoption difficult, and risks
excluding entire regions of the world that do not get lucky in the
initial bootstrapping process.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong>: while social-graph-based approaches avoid
collecting biometric data, they often end up leaking info about a
person's social relationships, which may lead to even greater risks. Of
course, zero-knowledge technology can mitigate this (eg. see <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/blind-find-private-social-network-search/6988">this
proposal by Barry Whitehat</a>), but the interdependency inherent in a
graph and the need to perform mathematical analyses on the graph makes
it harder to achieve the same level of data-hiding that you can with
biometrics.</li>
<li><strong>Inequality</strong>: each person can only have one biometric
ID, but a wealthy and socially well-connected person could use their
connections to generate many IDs. Essentially, the same flexibility that
might allow a social-graph-based system to give multiple pseudonyms to
someone (eg. an activist) that really needs that feature would likely
also imply that more powerful and well-connected people can gain more
pseudonyms than less powerful and well-connected people.</li>
<li><strong>Risk of collapse into centralization</strong>: most people
are too lazy to spend time reporting into an internet app who is a real
person and who is not. As a result, there is a risk that the system will
come over time to favor "easy" ways to get inducted that depend on
centralized authorities, and the "social graph" that the system users
will de-facto become the social graph of which countries recognize which
people as citizens - giving us centralized KYC with needless extra
steps.</li>
</ul>
<h3
id="is-proof-of-personhood-compatible-with-pseudonymity-in-the-real-world">Is
proof of personhood compatible with pseudonymity in the real world?</h3>
<p>In principle, proof of personhood is compatible with all kinds of
pseudonymity. Applications could be designed in such a way that someone
with a single proof of personhood ID can create up to five profiles
within the application, leaving room for pseudonymous accounts. One
could even use <a href="../../../2019/12/07/quadratic.html">quadratic
formulas</a>: N accounts for a cost of $N². But will they?</p>
<p>A pessimist, however, might argue that it is naive to try to create a
more privacy-friendly form of ID and hope that it will actually get
adopted in the right way, because the powers-that-be are not
privacy-friendly, and if a powerful actor gets a tool that
<em>could</em> be used to get much more information about a person, they
<em>will</em> use it that way. In such a world, the argument goes, the
only <em>realistic</em> approach is, unfortunately, to throw sand in the
gears of <em>any</em> identity solution, and defend a world with full
anonymity and digital islands of high-trust communities.</p>
<p>I see the reasoning behind this way of thinking, but I worry that
such an approach would, even if successful, lead to a world where
there's no way for anyone to do anything to counteract wealth
concentration and governance centralization, because one person could
always pretend to be ten thousand. Such points of centralization would,
in turn, be easy for the powers-that-be to capture. Rather, I would
favor a moderate approach, where we vigorously advocate for
proof-of-personhood solutions to have strong privacy, potentially if
desired even include a "N accounts for $N²" mechanism at protocol layer,
and create something that has privacy-friendly values <em>and</em> has a
chance of getting accepted by the outside world.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-do-i-think">So... what do I think?</h2>
<p>There is no ideal form of proof of personhood. Instead, we have at
least three different paradigms of approaches that all have their own
unique strengths and weaknesses. A comparison chart might look as
follows:</p>

<p><strong>What we should ideally do is treat these three techniques as
complementary, and combine them all</strong>. As India's Aadhaar has
shown at scale, specialized-hardware biometrics have their benefits of
being secure at scale. They are very weak at decentralization, though
this can be addressed by holding individual Orbs accountable.
General-purpose biometrics can be adopted very easily today, but their
security is rapidly dwindling, and they may only work for another 1-2
years. Social-graph-based systems bootstrapped off of a few hundred
people who are socially close to the founding team are likely to face
constant tradeoffs between completely missing large parts of the world
and being vulnerable to attacks within communities they have no
visibility into. A social-graph-based system bootstrapped off tens of
millions of biometric ID holders, however, could actually work.
Biometric bootstrapping may work better short-term, and
social-graph-based techniques may be more robust long-term, and take on
a larger share of the responsibility over time as their algorithms
improve.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>All of these teams are in a position to make many mistakes, and there
are inevitable tensions between business interests and the needs of the
wider community, so it's important to exercise a lot of vigilance. As a
community, we can and should push all participants' comfort zones on
open-sourcing their tech, demand third-party audits and even
third-party-written software, and other checks and balances. We also
need more alternatives in each of the three categories.</p>
<p>At the same time it's important to recognize the work already done:
many of the teams running these systems have shown a willingness to take
privacy much more seriously than pretty much any government or major
corporate-run identity systems, and this is a success that we should
build on.</p>
<p>The problem of making a proof-of-personhood system that is effective
and reliable, especially in the hands of people distant from the
existing crypto community, seems quite challenging. I definitely do not
envy the people attempting the task, and it will likely take years to
find a formula that works. The concept of proof-of-personhood in
principle seems very valuable, and while the various implementations
have their risks, not having any proof-of-personhood at all has its
risks too: a world with no proof-of-personhood seems more likely to be a
world dominated by centralized identity solutions, money, small closed
communities, or some combination of all three. I look forward to seeing
more progress on all types of proof of personhood, and hopefully seeing
the different approaches eventually come together into a coherent
whole.</p>
