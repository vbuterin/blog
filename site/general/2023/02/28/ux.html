<title> Some personal user experiences </title>

<p><strong>In 2013</strong>, I went to a sushi restaurant beside the <a
href="https://archive.org/about/contact.php">Internet Archive in San
Francisco</a>, because I had heard that it accepted bitcoin for payments
and I wanted to try it out. When it came time to pay the bill, I asked
to pay in BTC. I scanned the QR code, and clicked "send". To my
surprise, the transaction did not go through; it appeared to have been
sent, but the restaurant was not receiving it. I tried again, still no
luck. I soon figured out that the problem was that my mobile internet
was not working well at the time. I had to walk over 50 meters toward
the Internet Archive nearby to access its wifi, which finally allowed me
to send the transaction.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson learned</strong>: internet is not 100% reliable, and
customer internet is less reliable than merchant internet. We need
in-person payment systems to have <em>some</em> functionality (NFC,
customer shows a QR code, whatever) to allow customers to transfer their
transaction data directly to the merchant if that's the best way to get
it broadcasted.</p>
<p><strong>In 2021</strong>, I attempted to pay for tea for myself and
my friends at a coffee shop in Argentina. In their defense, they did not
<em>intentionally</em> accept cryptocurrency: the owner simply
recognized me, and showed me that he had an account at a cryptocurrency
exchange, so I suggested to pay in ETH (using cryptocurrency exchange
accounts as wallets is a standard way to do in-person payments in Latin
America). Unfortunately, my first transaction of 0.003 ETH did not get
accepted, probably because it was under the exchange's 0.01 ETH deposit
minimum. I sent another 0.007 ETH. Soon, both got confirmed. (I did not
mind the 3x overpayment and treated it as a tip).</p>
<p><strong>In 2022</strong>, I attempted to pay for tea at a different
location. The first transaction failed, because the default transaction
from my mobile wallet sent with only 21000 gas, and the receiving
account was a contract that required extra gas to process the transfer.
Attempts to send a second transaction failed, because a UI glitch in my
phone wallet made it not possible to scroll down and edit the field that
contained the gas limit.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson learned</strong>: simple-and-robust UIs are better
than fancy-and-sleek ones. But also, most users don't even know what gas
limits are, so we really just need to have better defaults.</p>
<p><strong>Many times</strong>, there has been a surprisingly long time
delay between my transaction getting accepted on-chain, and the service
acknowledging the transaction, even as "unconfirmed". Some of those
times, I definitely got worried that there was some glitch with the
payment system on their side.</p>
<p><strong>Many times</strong>, there has been a surprisingly long and
unpredictable time delay between sending a transaction, and that
transaction getting accepted in a block. Sometimes, a transaction would
get accepted in a few seconds, but other times, it would take minutes or
even hours. Recently, <a
href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/eip-1559-faq">EIP-1559</a>
significantly improved this, ensuring that most transactions get
accepted into the next block, and even more recently the Merge improved
things further by stabilizing block times.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p><strong>However</strong>, outliers still remain. If you send a
transaction at the same time as when many others are sending
transactions and the base fee is spiking up, you risk the base fee going
too high and your transaction not getting accepted. Even worse, wallet
UIs suck at showing this. There are no big red flashing alerts, and very
little clear indication of what you're supposed to do to solve this
problem. Even to an expert, who knows that in this case you're supposed
to "speed up" the transaction by publishing a new transaction with
identical data but a higher max-basefee, it's often not clear where the
button to do that actually is.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson learned</strong>: UX around transaction inclusion
needs to be improved, though there are fairly simple fixes. Credit to
the <a href="https://brave.com/wallet/">Brave wallet</a> team for taking
my suggestions on this topic seriously, and first <a
href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/13228">increasing the
max-basefee tolerance from 12.5% to 33%</a>, and more recently <a
href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/28527">exploring
ways to make stuck transactions more obvious in the UI</a>.</p>
<p><strong>In 2019</strong>, I was testing out one of the earliest
wallets that was attempting to provide <a
href="../../../2021/01/11/recovery.html">social recovery</a>. Unlike my
preferred approach, which is smart-contract-based, their approach was to
use <a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/08/16/secret-sharing-erasure-coding-guide-aspiring-dropbox-decentralizer">Shamir's
secret sharing</a> to split up the private key to the account into five
pieces, in such a way that any three of those pieces could be used to
recover the private key. Users were expected to choose five friends
("<strong>guardians</strong>" in modern lingo), convince them to
download a separate mobile application, and provide a confirmation code
that would be used to create an encrypted connection from the user's
wallet to the friend's application through <a
href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> and send them their
share of the key.</p>
<p><strong>This approach quickly ran into problems for me</strong>. A
few months later, something happened to my wallet and I needed to
actually use the recovery procedure to recover it. I asked my friends to
perform the recovery procedure with me through their apps - but it did
not go as planned. Two of them lost their key shards, because they
switched phones and forgot to move the recovery application over. For a
third, the Firebase connection mechanism did not work for a long time.
Eventually, we figured out how to fix the issue, and recover the key. A
few months after that, however, the wallet broke again. This time, a
regular software update somehow accidentally reset the app's storage and
deleted its key. But I had not added enough recovery partners, because
the Firebase connection mechanism was too broken and was not letting me
successfully do that. I ended up losing a small amount of BTC and
ETH.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson learned</strong>: secret-sharing-based off-chain
social recovery is just really fragile and a bad idea unless there are
no other options. Your recovery guardians should not have to download a
separate application, because if you have an application <em>only</em>
for an exceptional situation like recovery, it's too easy to forget
about it and lose it. Additionally, requiring separate centralized
communication channels comes with all kinds of problems. Instead, the
way to add guardians should be to provide their ETH address, and
recovery should be done by smart contract, using <a
href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337">ERC-4337</a> account
abstraction wallets. This way, the guardians would only need to not lose
their Ethereum wallets, which is something that they already care much
more about not losing for other reasons.</p>
<p><strong>In 2021</strong>, I was attempting to save on fees when using
Tornado Cash, by using the "self-relay" option. Tornado Cash uses a
"relay" mechanism where a third party pushes the transaction on-chain,
because when you are withdrawing you generally do not yet have coins in
your withdrawal address, and you don't want to pay for the transaction
with your deposit address because that creates a public link between the
two addresses, which is the whole problem that Tornado Cash is trying to
prevent. The problem is that the relay mechanism is often expensive,
with relays charging a percentage fee that could go far above the actual
gas fee of the transaction.</p>
<p>To save costs, one time I used the relay for a first small withdrawal
that would charge lower fees, and then used the "self-relay" feature in
Tornado Cash to send a second larger withdrawal myself without using
relays. The problem is, I screwed up and accidentally did this while
logged in to my deposit address, so the deposit address paid the fee
instead of the withdrawal address. Oops, I created a public link between
the two.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson learned</strong>: wallet developers should start
thinking much more explicitly about privacy. Also, we need better forms
of account abstraction to remove the need for centralized or even
federated relays, and commoditize the relaying role.</p>
<h3 id="miscellaneous-stuff">Miscellaneous stuff</h3>
<ul>
<li>Many apps still do not work with the Brave wallet or the Status
browser; this is likely because they didn't do their homework properly
and rely on Metamask-specific APIs. Even Gnosis Safe did not work with
these wallets for a long time, leading me to have to write my own mini
Javascript dapp to make confirmations. Fortunately, the latest UI has
fixed this issue.</li>
<li>The ERC20 transfers pages on Etherscan (eg. <a
href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045#tokentxns">https://etherscan.io/address/0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045#tokentxns</a>)
are very easy to spam with fakes. Anyone can create a new ERC20 token
with logic that can issue a log that claims that I or any other specific
person sent someone else tokens. This is sometimes used to trick people
into thinking that I support some scam token when I actually have never
even heard of it.</li>
<li>Uniswap used to offer the functionality of being able to swap tokens
and have the output sent to a different address. This was really
convenient for when I have to pay someone in USDC but I don't have any
already on me. Now, the interface doesn't offer that function, and so I
have to convert and then send in a separate transaction, which is less
convenient and wastes more gas. I have since learned that Cowswap and
Paraswap offer the functionality, though Paraswap... currently does not
seem to work with the Brave wallet.</li>
<li><a href="https://login.xyz/">Sign in with Ethereum</a> is great, but
it's still difficult to use if you are trying to sign in on multiple
devices, and your Ethereum wallet is only available on one device.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>Good user experience is not about the average case, it is about the
worst case. A UI that is clean and sleek, but does some weird and
unexplainable thing 0.723% of the time that causes big problems, is
worse than a UI that exposes more gritty details to the user but at
least makes it easier to understand what's going on and fix any problem
that does arise.</p>
<p>Along with the all-important issue of high transaction fees due to
scaling not yet being fully solved, user experience is a key reason why
many Ethereum users, especially in the Global South, often opt for
centralized solutions instead of on-chain decentralized alternatives
that keep power in the hands of the user and their friends and family or
local community. User experience has made great strides over the years -
in particular, going from an average transaction taking minutes to get
included before EIP-1559 to an average transaction taking seconds to get
included after EIP-1559 and the merge, has been a night-and-day change
to how pleasant it is to use Ethereum. But more still needs to be
done.</p>
