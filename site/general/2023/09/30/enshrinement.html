<title> Should Ethereum be okay with enshrining more things in the protocol? </title>

<p><em>Special thanks to Justin Drake, Tina Zhen and Yoav Weiss for
feedback and review.</em></p>
<p>From the start of the Ethereum project, there was a strong philosophy
of trying to make the core Ethereum as simple as possible, and do as
much as possible by building protocols on top. In the blockchain space,
the "do it on L1" vs "focus on L2s" debate is typically thought of <a
href="../../../2019/12/26/mvb.html">as being primarily about
scaling</a>, but in reality, similar issues exist for serving many kinds
of Ethereum users' needs: digital asset exchange, privacy, usernames,
advanced cryptography, account safety, censorship resistance,
frontrunning protection, and the list goes on. More recently, however,
there has been some cautious interest in being willing to enshrine more
of these features into the core Ethereum protocol.</p>
<p>This post will go into some of the philosophical reasoning behind the
original minimal-enshrinement philosophy, as well as some more recent
ways of thinking about some of these ideas. The goal will be to start to
build toward a framework for better identifying possible targets where
enshrining certain features in the protocol might be worth
considering.</p>
<h2 id="early-philosophy-on-protocol-minimalism">Early philosophy on
protocol minimalism</h2>
<p>Early on in the history of what was then called "Ethereum 2.0", there
was a strong desire to create a clean, simple and beautiful protocol
that tried to do as little as possible itself, and left almost
everything up to users to build on top. Ideally, the protocol would
<em>just</em> be a virtual machine, and verifying a block would
<em>just</em> be a single virtual machine call.</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/enshrinement/whiteboard.png" /></p>
<p><em>A very approximate reconstruction-from-memory of a whiteboard
drawing Gavin Wood and I made back in early 2015, talking about what
Ethereum 2.0 would look like.</em></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>The "state transition function" (the function that processes a block)
would just be a single VM call, and all other logic would happen through
contracts: a few system-level contracts, but mostly contracts provided
by users. One really nice feature of this model is that even an entire
hard fork could be described as a single transaction to the block
processor contract, which would be approved through either offchain or
onchain governance and then run with escalated permissions.</p>
<p>These discussions back in 2015 particularly applied to two areas that
were on our minds: <strong>account abstraction</strong> and
<strong>scaling</strong>. In the case of scaling, the idea was to try to
create a maximally abstracted form of scaling that would feel like a
natural extension of the diagram above. A contract could make a call to
a piece of data that was not stored by most Ethereum nodes, and the
protocol would detect that, and resolve the call through some kind of
very generic scaled-computation functionality. From the virtual
machine's point of view, the call would go off into some separate
sub-system, and then some time later magically come back with the
correct answer.</p>
<p>This line of thinking was explored briefly, but soon abandoned,
because we were too preoccupied with verifying that any kind of
blockchain scaling <a
href="https://github.com/vbuterin/scalability_paper">was possible at
all</a>. Though as we will see later, the combination of <a
href="https://hackmd.io/@vbuterin/sharding_proposal">data availability
sampling</a> and <a
href="../../../2023/03/31/zkmulticlient.html">ZK-EVMs</a> means that one
possible future for Ethereum scaling might actually look surprisingly
close to that vision! For account abstraction, on the other hand, we
knew from the start that <em>some</em> kind of implementation was
possible, and so research immediately began to try to make something as
close as possible to the purist starting point of "a transaction is just
a call" into reality.</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/blob/develop-snapshot/ethereum/messages.py"><img
src="../../../../images/enshrinement/pyethereum_code.png" /></a></p>
<p><em>There is a lot of boilerplate code that occurs in between
processing a transaction and making the actual underlying EVM call out
of the sender address, and a lot more boilerplate that comes after. How
do we reduce this code to as close to nothing as possible?</em></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>One of the major pieces of code in here is
<code>validate_transaction(state, tx)</code>, which does things like
checking that the nonce and signature of the transaction are correct.
The <em>practical</em> goal of account abstraction was, from the start,
to allow the user to replace basic nonce-incrementing and ECDSA
validation with their own validation logic, so that users could more
easily use things like <a
href="../../../2021/01/11/recovery.html">social recovery and multisig
wallets</a>. Hence, finding a way to rearchitect
<code>apply_transaction</code> into just being a simple EVM call was not
simply a "make the code clean for the sake of making the code clean"
task; rather, it was about moving the logic into the user's account
code, to give users that needed flexibility.</p>
<p>However, the insistence on trying to make
<code>apply_transaction</code> contain as little enshrined logic as
possible ended up introducing a lot of challenges. To see why, let us
zoom in on one of the earliest account abstraction proposals, <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/86">EIP 86</a>:</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="specification">Specification</h3>
<p>If <code>block.number &gt;= METROPOLIS_FORK_BLKNUM</code>, then: 1.
If the signature of a transaction is <code>(0, 0, 0)</code> (ie.
<code>v = r = s = 0</code>), then treat it as valid and set the sender
address to <code>2**160 - 1</code> 2. Set the address of any contract
created through a creation transaction to equal
<code>sha3(0 + init code) % 2**160</code>, where <code>+</code>
represents concatenation, replacing the earlier address formula of
<code>sha3(rlp.encode([sender, nonce]))</code> 3. Create a new opcode at
<code>0xfb</code>, <code>CREATE_P2SH</code>, which sets the creation
address to <code>sha3(sender + init code) % 2**160</code>. If a contract
at that address already exists, fails and returns 0 as if the init code
had run out of gas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<p>Basically, if the signature is set to (0, 0, 0), then a transaction
really does become "just a call". The account itself would be
responsible for having code that parses the transaction, extracts and
verifies the signature and nonce, and pays fees; see <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/research/blob/master/eip86/eip_86_basic_account.se">here</a>
for an early example version of that code, and see <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/blob/develop-snapshot/ethereum/messages.py#L129">here</a>
for the very similar <code>validate_transaction</code> code that this
account code would be replacing.</p>
<p>In exchange for this simplicity at protocol layer, miners (or, today,
block proposers) gain the additional responsibility of running extra
logic for only accepting and forwarding transactions that go to accounts
whose code is set up to actually pay fees. What is that logic? Well,
honestly EIP-86 did not think <em>too</em> hard about it:</p>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that miners would need to have a strategy for accepting these
transactions. This strategy would need to be very discriminating,
because otherwise they run the risk of accepting transactions ) for the
<code>validate_transaction</code> code that this pre-account code would
be replacingthat do not pay them any fees, and possibly even
transactions that have no effect (eg. because the transaction was
already included and so the nonce is no longer current). One simple
approach is to have a whitelist for the codehash of accounts that they
accept transactions being sent to; approved code would include logic
that pays miners transaction fees. However, this is arguably too
restrictive; a looser but still effective strategy would be to accept
any code that fits the same general format as the above, consuming only
a limited amount of gas to perform nonce and signature checks and having
a guarantee that transaction fees will be paid to the miner. Another
strategy is to, alongside other approaches, try to process any
transaction that asks for less than 250,000 gas, and include it only if
the miner's balance is appropriately higher after executing the
transaction than before it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
If EIP-86 had been included as-is, it would have reduced the complexity
of the EVM, at the cost of massively increasing the complexity of other
parts of the Ethereum stack, requiring essentially the exact same code
to be written in other places, in addition to introducing entirely new
classes of weirdness such as the possibility that the same transaction
with the same hash might appear multiple times in the chain, not to
mention the multi-invalidation problem.
<center>

<p><img

<p><em>The multi-invalidation problem in account abstraction. One
transaction getting included on chain could invalidate thousands of
other transactions in the mempool, making the mempool easy to cheaply
flood.</em></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Acccount abstraction evolved in stages from there. EIP-86 became <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/208">EIP-208</a>, which
later became this <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/tradeoffs-in-account-abstraction-proposals/263">ethresear.ch
post on "tradeoffs in account abstraction proposals"</a>, which then
became <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/a-recap-of-where-we-are-at-on-account-abstraction/1721">this
ethresear.ch post</a> half a year later. Eventually, out of all this,
came the actually somewhat-workable <a
href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2938">EIP-2938</a>.</p>
<p>EIP-2938, however, <em>was not minimalistic at all</em>. The EIP
includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new transaction type</li>
<li>Three new transaction-wide global variables</li>
<li>Two new opcodes, including the highly unwieldy <code>PAYGAS</code>
opcode that handles gas price and gas limit checking, being an EVM
execution breakpoint, and temporarily storing ETH for fee payments all
at once.</li>
<li>A set of complex mining and rebroadcasting strategies, including a
list of banned opcodes for the validation phase of a transaction</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to get account abstraction off the ground without involving
Ethereum core developers who were busy on heroic efforts optimizing the
Ethereum clients and implementing the merge, EIP-2938 eventually was
rearchitected into the entirely <a
href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337">extra-protocol
ERC-4337</a>.</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/enshrinement/erc4337.png" /></p>
<p><em>ERC-4337. It really does rely entirely on EVM calls for
everything!</em></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Because it's an ERC, it does not require a hard fork, and technically
lives "outside of the Ethereum protocol". So.... problem solved? Well, as
it turns out, not quite. The <em>current</em> <a
href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/account_abstraction_roadmap">medium-term
roadmap for ERC-4337</a> actually does involve eventually turning large
parts of ERC-4337 into a series of protocol features, and it's a useful
instructive example to see the reasons why this path is being
considered.</p>
<h2 id="enshrining-erc-4337">Enshrining ERC-4337</h2>
<p>There have been a few key reasons discussed for eventually bringing
ERC-4337 back into the protocol:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gas efficiency</strong>: Anything done inside the EVM incurs
some level of virtual machine overhead, including inefficiency in how it
uses gas-expensive features like storage slots. Currently, these extra
inefficiencies add up to at least ~20,000 gas, and often more. Pushing
these components into the protocol is the easiest way to remove these
issues.</li>
<li><strong>Code bug risk</strong>: if the ERC-4337 "entry point
contract" has a sufficiently terrible bug, <em>all</em>
ERC-4337-compatible wallets could see all of their funds drained.
Replacing the contract with an in-protocol functionality creates an
implied responsibility to fix code bugs with a hard fork, which removes
funds-draining risk for users.</li>
<li><strong>Support for EVM opcodes like
<code>tx.origin</code></strong>. ERC-4337, by itself, makes
<code>tx.origin</code> return the address of the "bundler" that packaged
up a set of user operations into a transaction. Native account
abstraction could fix this, by making <code>tx.origin</code> point to
the actual account sending the transaction, making it work the same way
as for EOAs.</li>
<li><strong>Censorship resistance</strong>: one of the <a
href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/pbs_censorship_resistance">challenges
with proposer/builder separation</a> is that it becomes easier to censor
individual transactions. In a world where individual
<em>transactions</em> are legible to the Ethereum protocol, this problem
can be greatly mitigated with <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/no-free-lunch-a-new-inclusion-list-design/16389">inclusion
lists</a>, which allow proposers to specify a list of transactions that
<em>must</em> be included within the next two slots in almost all cases.
But the extra-protocol ERC-4337 wraps "user operations" inside a single
transaction, making user operations opaque to the Ethereum protocol;
hence, Ethereum-protocol-provided inclusion lists would not be able to
provide censorship resistance to ERC-4337 user operations. Enshrining
ERC-4337, and making user operations a "proper" transaction type, would
solve this problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's worth zooming into the gas efficiency issue further. In its
current form, ERC-4337 is significantly more expensive than a "basic"
Ethereum transaction: the transaction costs 21,000 gas, whereas ERC-4337
costs ~42,000 gas. <a
href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/account_abstraction_roadmap?type=view#Reducing-gas-costs">This
doc</a> lists some of the reasons why:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Need to pay lots of individual storage read/write costs, which in
the case of EOAs get bundled into a single 21000 gas payment:
<ul>
<li>Editing the storage slot that contains pubkey+nonce (~5000)</li>
<li>UserOperation calldata costs (~4500, reducible to ~2500 with
compression)</li>
<li>ECRECOVER (~3000)</li>
<li>Warming the wallet itself (~2600)</li>
<li>Warming the recipient account (~2600)</li>
<li>Transferring ETH to the recipient account (~9000)</li>
<li>Editing storage to pay fees (~5000)</li>
<li>Access the storage slot containing the proxy (~2100) and then the
proxy itself (~2600)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>On top of the above storage read/write costs, the contract needs to
do "business logic" (unpacking the UserOperation, hashing it, shuffling
variables, etc) that EOA transactions have handled "for free" by the
Ethereum protocol</li>
<li>Need to expend gas to pay for logs (EOAs don't issue logs)</li>
<li>One-time contract creation costs (~32000 base, plus 200 gas per code
byte in the proxy, plus 20000 to set the proxy address)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Theoretically, it should be possible to massage the EVM gas cost
system until the in-protocol costs and the extra-protocol costs for
accessing storage match; there is no reason why transferring ETH needs
to cost 9000 gas when other kinds of storage-editing operations are much
cheaper. And indeed, two EIPs (<a
href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/verkle_tree_eip">[1]</a> <a
href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/verkle_write_gas_extension">[2]</a>)
related to the upcoming <a href="../../../2021/06/18/verkle.html">Verkle
tree</a> transition actually try to do that. But even if we do that,
there is one huge reason why enshrined protocol features are going to
inevitably be significantly cheaper than EVM code, no matter how
efficient the EVM becomes: <strong>enshrined code does not need to pay
gas for being pre-loaded</strong>.</p>
<p>Fully functional ERC-4337 wallets are <em>big</em>. <a
href="https://github.com/etherspot/etherspot-prime-contracts/tree/master/src/wallet">This
implementation</a>, compiled and put on chain, <a
href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xfB32cef50CfB0A0F9f6d37A05828b2F56EfdfE20#code">takes
up ~12,800 bytes</a>. Of course, you can deploy that big piece of code
once, and use <code>DELEGATECALL</code> to allow each individual wallet
to call into it, but that code still needs to be accessed in each block
that uses it. Under the <a
href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/verkle_tree_eip">Verkle tree
gas costs EIP</a>, 12,800 bytes would make up 413 chunks, and accessing
those chunks would require paying 2x <code>WITNESS_BRANCH_COST</code>
(3,800 gas total) and 413x <code>WITNESS_CHUNK_COST</code> (82,600 gas
total). And this does not even begin to mention the ERC-4337 entry-point
itself, with <a
href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x5FF137D4b0FDCD49DcA30c7CF57E578a026d2789#code">23,689
bytes onchain</a> in version 0.6.0 (under the Verkle tree EIP rules,
~158,700 gas to load).</p>
<p>This leads to a problem: the gas costs of actually accessing this
code would have to be split among transactions somehow. The current
approach that ERC-4337 uses is not great: the first transaction in a
bundle eats up one-time storage/code reading costs, making it much more
expensive than the rest of the transactions. Enshrinement in-protocol
would allow these commonly-shared libraries to simply be part of the
protocol, accessible to all with no fees.</p>
<h2
id="what-can-we-learn-from-this-example-about-when-to-enshrine-things-more-generally">What
can we learn from this example about when to enshrine things more
generally?</h2>
<p>In this example, we saw a few different rationales for enshrining
aspects of account abstraction in the protocol.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Move complexity to the edges" market-based approaches break
down the most when there are high fixed costs</strong>. And indeed, the
long term account abstraction roadmap looks like it's going to have
<em>lots</em> of fixed costs per block. 244,100 gas for loading
standardized wallet code is one thing; but <a
href="https://www.stackup.sh/blog/understanding-aggregators-in-erc-4337">aggregation</a>
(see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSLUpOpsPF0">my
presentation from this summer</a> for more details) potentially adds
hundreds of thousands more gas for ZK-SNARK validation plus onchain
costs for proof verification. There isn't a way to charge users for
these costs without introducing lots of market inefficiencies, whereas
making some of these functionalities into protocol features accessible
to all with no fees cleanly solves that problem.</li>
<li><strong>Community-wide response to code bugs</strong>. If some set
of pieces of code are used by all users, or a very wide class of users,
then it often makes more sense for the blockchain community to take on
itself the responsibility to hard-fork to fix any bugs that arise.
ERC-4337 introduced a large amount of globally shared code, and in the
long term it makes more sense for bugs in that code to be fixed by hard
forks than to lead to users losing a large amount of ETH.</li>
<li><strong>Sometimes, a stronger form of a feature can be implemented
by directly taking advantage of the powers of the protocol</strong>. The
key example here is in-protocol censorship resistance features like
inclusion lists: in-protocol inclusion lists can do a better job of
guaranteeing censorship resistance than extra-protocol approaches, in
order for user-level operations to actually benefit from in-protocol
inclusion lists, individual user-level operations need to be "legible"
to the protocol. Another lesser-known example is that 2017-era Ethereum
proof of stake designs had <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/research/blob/master/casper4/simple_casper.v.py#L331">account
abstraction for staking keys</a>, and this was abandoned in favor of
enshrining BLS because <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/pragmatic-signature-aggregation-with-bls/2105">BLS
supported an "aggregation" mechanism</a>, which would have to be
implemented at protocol and network level, that could make handling a
very large number of signatures much more efficient.</li>
</ul>
<p>But it is important to remember that <strong>even enshrined
in-protocol account abstraction is still a massive "de-enshrinement"
compared to the status quo.</strong> Today, top-level Ethereum
transactions can only be initiated from <a
href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/">externally
owned accounts (EOAs)</a> which use a single secp256k1 elliptic curve
signature for verification. Account abstraction de-enshrines this, and
leaves verification conditions open for users to define. And so, in this
story about account abstraction, we also saw the biggest argument
<em>against</em> enshrinement: <strong>being flexible to diverse users'
needs</strong>.</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img
src="../../../../images/enshrinement/enshrinement1.drawio.png" /></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Let us try to fill in the story further, by looking at a few other
examples of features that have recently been considered for
enshrinement. We'll particularly focus on: <strong>ZK-EVMs</strong>,
<strong>proposer-builder separation</strong>, <strong>private
mempools</strong>, <strong>liquid staking</strong> and <strong>new
precompiles</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="enshrining-zk-evms">Enshrining ZK-EVMs</h2>
<p>Let us switch focus to another potential target for enshrining into
the Ethereum protocol: ZK-EVMs. Currently, we have a large number of <a
href="../../../2021/01/05/rollup.html">ZK-rollups</a> that all have to
write fairly similar code to <a
href="../../../2022/08/04/zkevm.html">verify execution of Ethereum-like
blocks inside a ZK-SNARK</a>. There is a pretty diverse ecosystem of
independent implementations: <a
href="https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zkevm-circuits">the
PSE ZK-EVM</a>, <a href="https://www.kakarot.org/">Kakarot</a>, <a
href="https://polygon.technology/polygon-zkevm">the Polygon ZK-EVM</a>,
<a href="https://linea.build">Linea</a>, <a
href="https://www.risczero.com/news/zeth-release">Zeth</a>, and the list
goes on.</p>
<p>One of the recent controversies in the EVM ZK-rollup space has to do
with how to deal with the possibility of bugs in the ZK-code. Currently,
all of these systems that are live have some form of "security council"
mechanism that can override the proving system in case of a bug. In <a
href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571">this
post last year</a>, I tried to create a standardized framework to
encourage projects to be clear about what level of trust they put in the
proving system and what level in the security council, and move toward
giving less and less powers to the security council over time.</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/enshrinement/multiprovers.png" /></p>
<p><em>In the medium term, rollups could rely on <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hfVzCWT6YI">multiple proving
systems</a>, and the security council would only have any power at all
in the extreme case where two different proving systems disagree with
each other.</em></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>However, there is a sense in which some of this work <em>feels
superfluous</em>. We already have the Ethereum base layer, which has an
EVM, and we already have a working mechanism for dealing with bugs in
implementations: if there's a bug, the clients that have the bug update
to fix the bug, and the chain goes on. Blocks that appeared finalized
from the perspective of a buggy client would end up no-longer-finalized,
but at least we would not see users losing funds. Similarly, if a rollup
just wants to be and remain EVM-equivalent, it feels wrong that they
need to implement their own governance to keep changing their internal
ZK-EVM rules to match upgrades to the Ethereum base layer, when
ultimately they're building on top of the Ethereum base layer itself,
which knows when it's being upgraded and to what new rules.</p>
<p>Since these L2 ZK-EVMs are basically using the exact same EVM as
Ethereum, can't we somehow make "verify EVM execution in ZK" into a
protocol feature, and deal with exceptional situations like bugs and
upgrades by just applying Ethereum's social consensus, the same way we
already do for base-layer EVM execution itself?</p>
<p>This is an important and challenging topic. There are a few
nuances:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>We want to be <a
href="../../../2023/03/31/zkmulticlient.html">compatible with Ethereum's
multi-client philosophy</a></strong>. This means that we want to allow
different clients to use different proving systems. This in turn implies
that for any EVM execution that gets proven with one ZK-SNARK system, we
want a guarantee that the underlying data is <em><a
href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-availability/">available</a></em>,
so that proofs can be generated for other ZK-SNARK systems.</li>
<li><strong>While the tech is immature, we probably want
auditability.</strong> In practice, this means the exact same thing: if
any execution gets proven, we want the underlying data to be available,
so that if anything goes wrong, users and developers can inspect
it.</li>
<li><strong>We need much faster proving times</strong>, so that if one
type of proof is made, other types of proof can be generated quickly
enough that other clients can validate them. One <em>could</em> get
around this by making a precompile that has an asynchronous response
after some time window longer than a slot (eg. 3 hours), but this adds
complexity.</li>
<li><strong>We want to support not just copies of the EVM, but also
"almost-EVMs".</strong> Part of the attraction of L2s is the ability to
innovate on the execution layer, and make extensions to the EVM. If a
given L2's VM differs from the EVM only a little bit, it would be nice
if the L2 could still use a native in-protocol ZK-EVM for the parts that
are identical to the EVM, and only rely on their own code for the parts
that are different. This could be done by designing the ZK-EVM
precompile in such a way that it allows the caller to specify a bitfield
or list of opcodes or addresses that get handled by an externally
supplied table instead of the EVM itself. We could also make gas costs
open to customization to a limited extent.</li>
</ol>
<p>One likely topic of contention with data availability in a native
ZK-EVM is <strong>statefulness</strong>. ZK-EVMs are much more
data-efficient if they do not have to carry "witness" data. That is, if
a particular piece of data was already read or written in some previous
block, we can simply assume that provers have access to it, and we don't
have to make it available again. This goes beyond not re-loading storage
and code; it turns out that if a rollup properly <em>compresses</em>
data, the compression being <em>stateful</em> allows for up to 3x data
savings compared to the compression being stateless.</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><a
href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FZRpiqVakAAquDa?format=jpg&amp;name=medium"><img
src="../../../../images/enshrinement/compression.png" /></a></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>This means that for a ZK-EVM precompile, we have two options:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>The precompile requires all data to be available in the same
block</strong>. This means that provers can be stateless, but it also
means that ZK-rollups using such a precompile become much more expensive
than rollups using custom code.</li>
<li><strong>The precompile allows pointers to data used or generated by
<em>previous</em> executions.</strong> This allows ZK-rollups to be
near-optimal, but it's more complicated and introduces a new kind of
state that has to be stored by provers.</li>
</ol>
<p>What lessons can we take away from this? There is a pretty good
argument to enshrine ZK-EVM validation somehow: rollups are already
building their own custom versions of it, and it <em>feels wrong</em>
that Ethereum is willing to put the weight of its multiple
implementations and off-chain social consensus behind EVM execution on
L1, but L2s doing the exact same work have to instead implement
complicated gadgets involving security councils. But on the other hand,
there is a big devil in the details: there are different versions of an
enshrined ZK-EVM that have different costs and benefits. The stateful vs
stateless divide only scratches the surface; attempting to support
"almost-EVMs" that have custom code proven by other systems will likely
reveal an even larger design space. Hence, <strong>enshrining ZK-EVMs
presents both promise and challenges</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="enshrining-proposer-builder-separation-epbs">Enshrining
proposer-builder separation (ePBS)</h2>
<p>The rise of <a
href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/mev/">MEV</a> has made
block production into an economies-of-scale-heavy activity, with
sophisticated actors being able to produce blocks that generate much
more revenue than default algorithms that simply watch the mempool for
transactions and include them. The Ethereum community has so far
attempted to deal with this by using <em>extra-protocol proposer-builder
separation</em> schemes like <a
href="https://boost.flashbots.net/">MEV-Boost</a>, which allow regular
validators ("proposers") to outsource block building to specialized
actors ("builders").</p>
<p>However, MEV-Boost carries a trust assumption in a new category of
actor, called a <em>relay</em>. For the past two years, there have been
<a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/why-enshrine-proposer-builder-separation-a-viable-path-to-epbs/15710">many
proposals to create "enshrined PBS"</a>. What is the benefit of this? In
this case, the answer is pretty simple: the PBS that can be built by
directly using the powers of the protocol is simply stronger (in the
sense of having weaker trust assumptions) than the PBS that can be built
without them. It's a similar case to the case for <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/enshrined-eth2-price-feeds/7391">enshrining
in-protocol price oracles</a> - though, in <em>that</em> situation,
there is also a <a href="../../../2023/05/21/dont_overload.html">strong
counterargument</a>.</p>
<h2 id="enshrining-private-mempools">Enshrining private mempools</h2>
<p>When a user sends a transaction, that transaction becomes immediately
public and visible to all, even before it gets included on chain. This
makes users of many applications vulnerable to economic attacks such as
frontrunning: if a user makes a large trade on eg. Uniswap, an attacker
could put in a transaction right before them, increasing the price at
which they buy, and collecting an arbitrage profit.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a number of projects specializing in
creating "private mempools" (or "encrypted mempools"), which keep users'
transactions encrypted until the moment they get irreversibly accepted
into a block.</p>
<p>The problem is, however, that schemes like this require a particular
kind of encryption: to prevent users from flooding the system and
frontrunning the decryption process <em>itself</em>, the encryption must
auto-decrypt once the transaction actually does get irreversibly
accepted.</p>
<p>To implement such a form of encryption, there are various different
technologies with different tradeoffs, described well in <a
href="https://joncharbonneau.substack.com/p/encrypted-mempools">this
post by Jon Charbonneau</a> (and <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHDjgFcha0M">this video</a> and <a
href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gExeL9aiHtD6mlo_iVWLYnZvFTmsNWTTcfyoNENcCdw">slides</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Encryption to a centralized operator</strong>, eg. <a
href="https://medium.com/alchemistcoin/how-to-add-flashbots-protect-rpc-to-your-metamask-3f1412a16787">Flashbots
Protect</a>.</li>
<li><a
href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/RSW96.pdf"><strong>Time-lock
encryption</strong></a>, a form of encryption which can be decrypted by
anyone after a certain number of <em>sequential</em> computational
steps, which cannot be parallelized.</li>
<li><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_cryptosystem"><strong>Threshold
encryption</strong></a>, trusting an honest majority committee to
decrypt the data. See the <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/shutterized-beacon-chain/12249">shutterized
beacon chain</a> concept for a concrete proposal.</li>
<li><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment"><strong>Trusted
hardware</strong></a> such as <a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128161975000085">SGX</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, each of these have varying weaknesses. A centralized
operator is not acceptable for inclusion in-protocol for obvious
reasons. Traditional time lock encryption is too expensive to run across
thousands of transactions in a public mempool. A more powerful primitive
called <strong>delay encryption</strong> allows efficient decryption of
an unlimited number of messages, but it's hard to construct in practice,
and <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/statement-regarding-the-public-report-on-the-analysis-of-minroot/16670">attacks
on existing constructions</a> still sometimes get discovered. Much like
<a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/hash-functions/">with hash
functions</a>, we'll likely need a period of more years of research and
analysis before delay encryption becomes sufficiently mature. Threshold
encryption requires trusting a majority to not collude, in a setting
where they can collude <em>undetectably</em> (unlike 51% attacks, where
it's immediately obvious who participated). SGX creates a dependency on
a single trusted manufacturer.</p>
<p><strong>While for each solution, there is some subset of users that
is comfortable trusting it, there is no single solution that is trusted
enough that it can practically be accepted into layer 1.</strong> Hence,
enshrining anti-frontrunning at layer 1 seems like a difficult
proposition at least until delay encrypted is perfected or there is some
other technological breakthrough, even while it's a valuable enough
functionality that lots of application solutions will already
emerge.</p>
<h2 id="enshrining-liquid-staking">Enshrining liquid staking</h2>
<p>A common demand among Ethereum defi users is the ability to use their
ETH for staking and as collateral in other applications at the same
time. Another common demand is simply for convenience: users want to be
able to stake without the complexity of running a node and keeping it
online all the time (and protecting their now-online staking keys).</p>
<p>By far the simplest possible "interface" for staking, which satisfies
both of these needs, is just an ERC20 token: convert your ETH into
"staked ETH", hold it, and then later convert back. And indeed, liquid
staking providers such as <a href="https://lido.fi/">Lido</a> and <a
href="https://rocketpool.net/">Rocketpool</a> have emerged to do just
that. However, liquid staking has some natural centralizing mechanics at
play: people naturally go into the biggest version of staked ETH because
it's most familiar and most liquid (and most well-supported by
applications, who in turn support it because it's more familiar and
because it's the one the most users will have heard of).</p>
<p>Each version of staked ETH needs to have some mechanism determining
who can be the underlying node operators. It can't be unrestricted,
because then attackers would join and amplify their attacks with users'
funds. Currently, the top two are Lido, which has a DAO whitelisting
node operators, and Rocket Pool, which allows anyone to run a node if
they <a href="https://docs.rocketpool.net/overview/faq.html">put down 8
ETH</a> (ie. 1/4 of the capital) as a deposit. These two approaches have
different risks: the Rocket Pool approach allows attackers to 51% attack
the network, and force users to pay most of the costs. With the DAO
approach, if a single such staking token dominates, that leads to a
single, <a href="../../../2021/09/26/limits.html">potentially</a> <a
href="../../../2021/08/16/voting3.html">attackable</a> governance gadget
controlling a very large portion of all Ethereum validators. To the
credit of protocols like Lido, they have <a
href="https://lido.fi/governance">implemented safeguards against
this</a>, but one layer of defense may not be enough.</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><a href="https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking"><img
src="../../../../images/enshrinement/eth2_staking.png" /></a></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the short term, one option is to socially encourage ecosystem
participants to use a diversity of liquid staking providers, to reduce
the chance that any single one becomes too large to be a systemic risk.
In the longer term, however, this is an unstable equilibrium, and there
is peril in relying too much on moralistic pressure to solve problems.
One natural question arises: <strong>might it make sense to enshrine
some kind of in-protocol functionality to make liquid staking less
centralizing</strong>?</p>
<p>Here, the key question is: <em>what kind of in-protocol
functionality</em>? Simply creating an in-protocol fungible "staked ETH"
token has the problem that it would have to either have an enshrined
Ethereum-wide governance to choose who runs the nodes, or be open-entry,
turning it into a vehicle for attackers.</p>
<p>One interesting idea is <a
href="https://notes.ethereum.org/bW2PeHdwRWmeYjCgCJJdVA">Dankrad Feist's
writings on liquid staking maximalism</a>. First, we bite the bullet
that if Ethereum gets 51% attacked, only perhaps 5% of the attacking ETH
gets slashed. This is a reasonable tradeoff; right now there is <a
href="https://beaconcha.in/">over 26 million ETH being staked</a>, and a
cost of attack of 1/3 of that (~8 million ETH) is way overkill,
especially considering how many kinds of "outside-the-model" attacks can
be pulled off for much less. Indeed, a similar tradeoff has already been
explored in the <a
href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/single_slot_finality#Idea-1-super-committees">"super-committee"
proposal</a> for implementing single-slot finality.</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img
src="../../../../images/enshrinement/deposit_piechart.png" /></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>If we accept that only 5% of attacking ETH gets slashed, then over
90% of staked ETH would be invulnerable to slashing, and so 90% of
staked ETH could be put into an in-protocol fungible liquid staking
token that can then be used by other applications.</p>
<p>This path is interesting. But it still leaves open the question:
<strong>what is the specific thing that would get enshrined</strong>? <a
href="https://rocketpool.net/">RocketPool</a> already works in a way
very similar to this: each node operator puts up some capital, and
liquid stakers put up the rest. We could simply tweak a few constants,
bounding the maximum slashing penalty to eg. 2 ETH, and Rocket Pool's
<em>existing</em> rETH would become risk-free.</p>
<p>There are other clever things that we can do with simple protocol
tweaks. For example, imagine that we want a system where there are <a
href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@mikeneuder/goldilocks">two "tiers" of
staking</a>: node operators (high collateral requirement) and depositors
(no minimum, can join and leave any time), but we still want to guard
against node operator centralization by giving a randomly-sampled
committee of depositors powers like suggesting lists of transactions
that have to be included (for anti-censorship reasons), controlling the
fork choice during an inactivity leak, or needing to sign off on blocks.
This could be done in a mostly-out-of-protocol way, by tweaking the
protocol to require each <em>validator</em> to provide (i) a regular
staking key, and (ii) an ETH address that can be called to output a
secondary staking key during each slot. The protocol would give powers
to these two keys, but the mechanism for choosing the second key in each
slot could be left to staking pool protocols. It may still be better to
enshrine some things outright, but it's valuable to note that this
"enshrine some things, leave other things to users" design space
exists.</p>
<h2 id="enshrining-more-precompiles">Enshrining more precompiles</h2>
<p><a
href="https://www.rareskills.io/post/solidity-precompiles">Precompiles</a>
(or "precompiled contracts") are Ethereum contracts that implement
complex cryptographic operations, whose logic is natively implemented in
client code, instead of EVM smart contract code. Precompiles were a
compromise adopted at the beginning of Ethereum's development: because
the overhead of a VM is too much for certain kinds of very complex and
highly specialized code, we can implement a few key operations valuable
to important kinds of applications in native code to make them faster.
Today, this basically includes a few specific <a
href="https://www.evm.codes/precompiled?fork=shanghai">hash functions
and elliptic curve operations</a>.</p>
<p>There is currently a push to add <a
href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7212">a precompile for
secp256r1</a>, an elliptic curve slightly different from the secp256k1
used for basic Ethereum accounts, because it is well-supported by
trusted hardware modules and thus widespread use of it could improve
wallet security. In recent years, there have also been pushes to add
precompiles for <a
href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7266">BLS-12-377</a>, <a
href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3026">BW6-761</a>, <a
href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1962">generalized pairings</a>
and other features.</p>
<p>The counterargument to these requests for more precompiles is that
many of the precompiles that have been added before (eg. <a
href="https://ethereum.github.io/execution-specs/autoapi/ethereum/frontier/vm/precompiled_contracts/ripemd160/index.html">RIPEMD</a>
and <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-152">BLAKE</a>) have
ended up gotten <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7266">used
much less than anticipated</a>, and we should learn from that. Instead
of adding more precompiles for specific operations, we should perhaps
focus on a more moderate approach based on ideas like <a
href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-6601-evm-modular-arithmetic-extensions-evmmax/13168">EVM-MAX</a>
and the dormant-but-always-revivable <a
href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-616">SIMD proposal</a>, which
would allow EVM implementations to execute wide classes of code less
expensively. Perhaps even <em>existing</em> little-used precompiles
could be removed and replaced with (unavoidably less efficient) EVM code
implementations of the same function. That said, it is still possible
that there are specific cryptographic operations that are valuable
enough to accelerate that it makes sense to add them as precompiles.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-we-learn-from-all-this">What do we learn from all
this?</h2>
<p>The desire to enshrine as little as possible is understandable and
good; it hails from the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">Unix philosophy
tradition</a> of creating software that is minimalist and can be easily
adapted to different needs by its users, avoiding the curses of software
bloat. However, <strong>blockchains are not personal-computing operating
systems; they are social systems</strong>. This means that there are
rationales for enshrining certain features in the protocol that go
beyond the rationales that exist in a purely personal-computing
context.</p>
<p>In many cases, these other examples re-capped similar lessons to what
we saw in account abstraction. But there are also a few new lessons that
have been learned as well:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enshrining features can help avoid centralization risks in
other areas of the stack</strong>. Often, keeping the base protocol
minimal and simple pushes the complexity to some outside-the-protocol
ecosystem. From a Unix philosophy perspective, this is good. Sometimes,
however, there are risks that that outside-the-protocol ecosystem will
centralize, often (but not just) because of high fixed costs. Enshrining
can sometimes decrease de-facto centralization.</li>
<li><strong>Enshrining too much can over-extend the trust and governance
load of the protocol</strong>. This is the topic of <a
href="../../../2023/05/21/dont_overload.html">this earlier post</a>
about not overloading Ethereum's consensus: if enshrining a particular
feature weakens the trust model, and makes Ethereum as a whole much more
"subjective", that weakens Ethereum's credible neutrality. In those
cases, it's better to leave that particular feature as a mechanism on
top of Ethereum, and not try to bring it inside Ethereum itself. Here,
encrypted mempools are the best example of something that may be a bit
too difficult to enshrine, at least until/unless delay encryption
technology improves.</li>
<li><strong>Enshrining too much can over-complicate the
protocol</strong>. Protocol complexity is a systemic risk, and adding
too many features in-protocol increases that risk. Precompiles are the
best example of this.</li>
<li><strong>Enshrining can backfire in the long term, as users' needs
are unpredictable</strong>. A feature that many people <em>think</em> is
important and will be used by many users may well turn out not to be
used much in practice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the liquid staking, ZK-EVM and precompile cases show
the possibility of a middle road: <strong>minimal viable
enshrinement</strong>. Rather than enshrining an entire functionality,
the protocol could enshrine a specific piece that solves the key
challenges with making that functionality easy to implement, without
being <em>too</em> opinionated or narrowly focused. Examples of this
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rather than enshrining a full liquid staking system, changing
staking penalty rules to make trustless liquid staking more viable</li>
<li>Rather than enshrining more precompiles, enshrine <a
href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-6601-evm-modular-arithmetic-extensions-evmmax/13168">EVM-MAX</a>
and/or <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-616">SIMD</a> to make
a wider class of operations simpler to implement efficiently</li>
<li>Rather than enshrining the whole concept of <em>rollups</em>, we
could simply enshrine EVM <em>verification</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can extend our diagram from earlier in the post as follows:</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img
src="../../../../images/enshrinement/enshrinement2.drawio.png" /></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sometimes, it may even make sense to <em>de-enshrine</em> a few
things. De-enshrining little-used precompiles is one example. Account
abstraction as a whole, as mentioned earlier, is also a significant form
of de-enshrinement. If we want to support backwards-compatibility for
existing users, then the mechanism may actually be surprisingly similar
to that for de-enshrining precompiles: one of the proposals is <a
href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5003">EIP-5003</a>, which would
allow EOAs to convert their account in-place into a contract that has
the same (or better) functionality.</p>
<p>What features should be brought into the protocol and what features
should be left to other layers of the ecosystem is a complicated
tradeoff, and we should expect the tradeoff to continue to evolve over
time as our understanding of users' needs and our suite of available
ideas and technologies continues to improve.</p>
