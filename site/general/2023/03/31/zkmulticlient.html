<title> How will Ethereum's multi-client philosophy interact with ZK-EVMs? </title>

<p><em>Special thanks to Justin Drake for feedback and review</em></p>
<p>One underdiscussed, but nevertheless very important, way in which
Ethereum maintains its security and decentralization is its
<strong>multi-client philosophy</strong>. Ethereum intentionally has no
"reference client" that everyone runs by default: instead, there is a
collaboratively-managed <strong>specification</strong> (these days <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs">written</a> in the
very human-readable but very slow <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs">Python</a>) and there
are multiple teams making <strong>implementations</strong> of the spec
(also called "<strong>clients</strong>"), which is what users actually
run.</p>
<center>
<p><br><a href="https://clientdiversity.org/"></p>
<p><img
src="../../../../images/zkmulticlient/clientdistribution.png" /></p>
<p></a><small><i>Each Ethereum node runs a consensus client and an
execution client. As of today, no consensus or execution client makes up
more than 2/3 of the network. If a client with less than 1/3 share in
its category has a bug, the network would simply continue as normal. If
a client with between 1/3 and 2/3 share in its category (so, Prysm,
Lighthouse or Geth) has a bug, the chain would continue adding blocks,
but it would stop finalizing blocks, giving time for developers to
intervene.</i></small></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>One underdiscussed, but nevertheless very important, major upcoming
transition in the way the Ethereum chain gets validated is the rise of
<strong>ZK-EVMs</strong>. <a
href="../../../2022/08/04/zkevm.html">SNARKs proving EVM execution</a>
have been under development for years already, and the technology is
actively being used by layer 2 protocols called <a
href="../../../2021/01/05/rollup.html">ZK rollups</a>. Some of these ZK
rollups are <a
href="https://blog.matter-labs.io/gm-zkevm-171b12a26b36">active</a> on
<a href="https://polygon.technology/polygon-zkevm">mainnet</a> today,
with <a href="https://scroll.io/">more</a> <a
href="https://taiko.xyz/">coming</a> <a
href="https://www.kakarot.org/">soon</a>. But in the longer term,
ZK-EVMs are not just going to be for rollups; we want to use them to
verify execution on layer 1 as well (see also: <a
href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1588669782471368704">the
Verge</a>).</p>
<p>Once that happens, ZK-EVMs de-facto become a third type of Ethereum
client, just as important to the network's security as execution clients
and consensus clients are today. And this naturally raises a question:
how will ZK-EVMs interact with the multi-client philosophy? One of the
hard parts is already done: we already have multiple ZK-EVM
implementations that are being actively developed. But other hard parts
remain: how would we actually make a "multi-client" ecosystem for
ZK-proving correctness of Ethereum blocks? This question opens up some
interesting technical challenges - and of course the looming question of
whether or not the tradeoffs are worth it.</p>
<h2
id="what-was-the-original-motivation-for-ethereums-multi-client-philosophy">What
was the original motivation for Ethereum's multi-client philosophy?</h2>
<p>Ethereum's multi-client philosophy is a type of decentralization, and
like <a
href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274">decentralization
in general</a>, one can focus on either the technical benefits of
architectural decentralization or the social benefits of political
decentralization. Ultimately, the multi-client philosophy was motivated
by both and serves both.</p>
<h3 id="arguments-for-technical-decentralization">Arguments for
technical decentralization</h3>
<p>The main benefit of technical decentralization is simple: it reduces
the risk that one bug in one piece of software leads to a catastrophic
breakdown of the entire network. A historical situation that exemplifies
this risk is the <a
href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-history-part-10-the-184-billion-btc-bug/">2010
Bitcoin overflow bug</a>. At the time, the Bitcoin client code did not
check that the sum of the outputs of a transaction does not overflow
(wrap around to zero by summing to above the maximum integer of <span
class="math inline">\(2^{64} - 1\)</span>), and so someone made a
transaction that did exactly that, giving themselves billions of
bitcoins. The bug was discovered within hours, and a fix was rushed
through and quickly deployed across the network, but had there been a
mature ecosystem at the time, those coins would have been accepted by
exchanges, bridges and other structures, and the attackers could have
gotten away with a lot of money. If there had been five different
Bitcoin clients, it would have been very unlikely that all of them had
the same bug, and so there would have been an immediate split, and the
side of the split that was buggy would have probably lost.</p>
<p>There is a tradeoff in using the multi-client approach to minimize
the risk of catastrophic bugs: instead, you get <strong>consensus
failure</strong> bugs. That is, if you have two clients, there is a risk
that the clients have subtly different interpretations of some protocol
rule, and while both interpretations are reasonable and do not allow
stealing money, the disagreement would cause the chain to split in half.
A serious split of that type happened <a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/11/25/security-alert-11242016-consensus-bug-geth-v1-4-19-v1-5-2">once
in Ethereum's history</a> (there have been other much smaller splits
where very small portions of the network running old versions of the
code forked off). Defenders of the single-client approach point to
consensus failures as a reason to not have multiple implementations: if
there is only one client, that one client will not disagree with itself.
Their model of how number of clients translates into risk might look
something like this:</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/zkmulticlient/riskchart.png" /></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>I, of course, disagree with this analysis. The crux of my
disagreement is that (i) 2010-style catastrophic bugs matter too, and
(ii) <strong>you never <em>actually</em> have only one client</strong>.
The latter point is made most obvious by the <a
href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-network-shaken-by-blockchain-fork-1363144448">Bitcoin
fork of 2013</a>: a chain split occurred because of a disagreement
between <em>two different versions</em> of the Bitcoin client, one of
which turned out to have an accidental and undocumented limit on the
number of objects that could be modified in a single block. Hence, one
client in theory is often two clients in practice, and five clients in
theory might be six or seven clients in practice - so we should just
take the plunge and go on the right side of the risk curve, and have at
least a few different clients.</p>
<h3 id="arguments-for-political-decentralization">Arguments for
political decentralization</h3>
<p>Monopoly client developers are in a position with a lot of political
power. If a client developer proposes a change, and users disagree,
<em>theoretically</em> they could refuse to download the updated
version, or create a fork without it, but <em>in practice</em> it's
often difficult for users to do that. What if a disagreeable protocol
change is bundled with a necessary security update? What if the main
team threatens to quit if they don't get their way? Or, more tamely,
what if the monopoly client team ends up being the only group with the
greatest protocol expertise, leaving the rest of the ecosystem in a poor
position to judge technical arguments that the client team puts forward,
leaving the client team with a lot of room to push their own particular
goals and values, which might not match with the broader community?</p>
<p>Concern about protocol politics, particularly in the context of the
<a
href="https://blog.bitmex.com/dapps-or-only-bitcoin-transactions-the-2014-debate/">2013-14
Bitcoin OP_RETURN wars</a> where some participants were openly in favor
of discriminating against particular usages of the chain, was a
significant contributing factor in Ethereum's early adoption of a
multi-client philosophy, which was aimed to make it harder for a small
group to make those kinds of decisions. Concerns specific to the
Ethereum ecosystem - namely, avoiding concentration of power within the
Ethereum Foundation itself - provided further support for this
direction. In 2018, a decision was made to intentionally have the
Foundation <em>not</em> make an implementation of the Ethereum PoS
protocol (ie. what is now called a "consensus client"), leaving that
task entirely to outside teams.</p>
<h2 id="how-will-zk-evms-come-in-on-layer-1-in-the-future">How will
ZK-EVMs come in on layer 1 in the future?</h2>
<p>Today, ZK-EVMs are used in rollups. This increases scaling by
allowing expensive EVM execution to happen only a few times off-chain,
with everyone else simply verifying <a
href="../../../2021/01/26/snarks.html">SNARKs</a> posted on-chain that
prove that the EVM execution was computed correctly. It also allows some
data (particularly signatures) to not be included on-chain, saving on
gas costs. This gives us a lot of scalability benefits, and the
combination of scalable computation with ZK-EVMs and scalable data with
<a
href="https://hackmd.io/@vbuterin/sharding_proposal#ELI5-data-availability-sampling">data
availability sampling</a> could let us scale very far.</p>
<p>However, the Ethereum network today also has a different problem, one
that no amount of layer 2 scaling can solve by itself: the layer 1 is
difficult to verify, to the point where not many users run their own
node. Instead, most users simply trust third-party providers. Light
clients such as <a
href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/building-helios-ethereum-light-client/">Helios</a>
and <a href="https://www.succinct.xyz/">Succinct</a> are taking steps
toward solving the problem, but a light client is far from a fully
verifying node: a light client merely verifies the signatures of a
random subset of validators called the <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/annotated-spec/blob/master/altair/sync-protocol.md">sync
committee</a>, and does not verify that the chain actually follows the
protocol rules. To bring us to a world where users can actually verify
that the chain follows the rules, we would have to do something
different.</p>
<h3
id="option-1-constrict-layer-1-force-almost-all-activity-to-move-to-layer-2">Option
1: constrict layer 1, force almost all activity to move to layer 2</h3>
<p>We could over time reduce the layer 1 gas-per-block target down from
15 million to 1 million, enough for a block to contain a single SNARK
and a few deposit and withdraw operations but not much else, and thereby
force almost all user activity to move to layer 2 protocols. Such a
design could still support many rollups committing in each block: we
could use <a
href="../../../2022/09/17/layer_3.html#rollups-and-validiums-have-a-confirmation-time-vs-fixed-cost-tradeoff.-layer-3s-can-help-fix-this.-but-what-else-can">off-chain
aggregation protocols</a> run by customized builders to gather together
SNARKs from multiple layer 2 protocols and combine them into a single
SNARK. <strong>In such a world, the <em>only</em> function of layer 1
would be to be a clearinghouse for layer 2 protocols, verifying their
proofs and occasionally facilitating large funds transfers between
them</strong>.</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img
src="../../../../images/zkmulticlient/proofaggregation.png" /></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>This approach could work, but it has several important
weaknesses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It's de-facto backwards-incompatible</strong>, in the sense
that many existing L1-based applications become economically nonviable.
User funds up to hundreds or thousands of dollars could get stuck as
fees become so high that they exceed the cost of emptying those
accounts. This could be addressed by letting users sign messages to opt
in to an in-protocol mass migration to an L2 of their choice (see some
<a
href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/some-medium-term-dust-cleanup-ideas/6287">early
implementation ideas here</a>), but this adds complexity to the
transition, and making it truly cheap enough would require <em>some</em>
kind of SNARK at layer 1 anyway. I'm generally a fan of breaking
backwards compatibility when it comes to <a
href="https://hackmd.io/@vbuterin/selfdestruct">things like the
SELFDESTRUCT opcode</a>, but in this case the tradeoff seems much less
favorable.</li>
<li><strong>It might still not make verification cheap enough</strong>.
Ideally, the Ethereum protocol should be easy to verify not just on
laptops but also inside phones, browser extensions, and even inside
other chains. Syncing the chain for the first time, or after a long time
offline, should also be easy. A laptop node could verify 1 million gas
in ~20 ms, but even that implies 54 seconds to sync after one day
offline (assuming <a
href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/single_slot_finality">single
slot finality</a> increases slot times to 32s), and for phones or
browser extensions it would take a few hundred milliseconds per block
and might still be a non-negligible battery drain. These numbers are
manageable, but they are not ideal.</li>
<li><strong>Even in an L2-first ecosystem, there are benefits to L1
being at least somewhat affordable</strong>. <a
href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/validium/">Validiums</a>
can benefit from a stronger security model if users can withdraw their
funds if they notice that new state data is no longer being made
available. Arbitrage becomes more efficient, especially for smaller
tokens, if the minimum size of an economically viable cross-L2 direct
transfer is smaller.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, it seems more reasonable to try to find a way to use ZK-SNARKs
to verify the layer 1 itself.</p>
<h3 id="option-2-snark-verify-the-layer-1">Option 2: SNARK-verify the
layer 1</h3>
<p>A <a
href="../../../2022/08/04/zkevm.html#type-1-fully-ethereum-equivalent">type
1 (fully Ethereum-equivalent) ZK-EVM</a> can be used to verify the EVM
execution of a (layer 1) Ethereum block. We could write more SNARK code
to also verify the consensus side of a block. This would be a
challenging engineering problem: today, ZK-EVMs take minutes to hours to
verify Ethereum blocks, and generating proofs in real time would require
one or more of (i) improvements to Ethereum itself to remove
SNARK-unfriendly components, (ii) either large efficiency gains with
specialized hardware, and (iii) architectural improvements with much
more parallelization. However, there is no fundamental technological
reason why it cannot be done - and so I expect that, even if it takes
many years, it will be done.</p>
<p><strong>Here is where we see the intersection with the multi-client
paradigm: if we use ZK-EVMs to verify layer 1, which ZK-EVM do we
use?</strong></p>
<p>I see three options:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Single ZK-EVM</strong>: abandon the multi-client paradigm,
and choose a single ZK-EVM that we use to verify blocks.</li>
<li><strong>Closed multi ZK-EVM</strong>: agree on and enshrine in
consensus a specific set of multiple ZK-EVMs, and have a consensus-layer
protocol rule that a block needs proofs from more than half of the
ZK-EVMs in that set to be considered valid.</li>
<li><strong>Open multi ZK-EVM</strong>: different clients have different
ZK-EVM implementations, and each client waits for a proof that is
compatible with its own implementation before accepting a block as
valid.</li>
</ol>
<p>To me, (3) seems ideal, at least until and unless our technology
improves to the point where we can <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification">formally
prove</a> that all of the ZK-EVM implementations are equivalent to each
other, at which point we can just pick whichever one is most efficient.
(1) would sacrifice the benefits of the multi-client paradigm, and (2)
would close off the possibility of developing new clients and lead to a
more centralized ecosystem. (3) has challenges, but those challenges
seem smaller than the challenges of the other two options, at least for
now.</p>
<p>Implementing (3) would not be too hard: one might have a p2p
sub-network for each type of proof, and a client that uses one type of
proof would listen on the corresponding sub-network and wait until they
receive a proof that their verifier recognizes as valid.</p>
<p>The two main challenges of (3) are likely the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The latency challenge</strong>: a malicious attacker could
publish a block late, along with a proof valid for one client. It would
realistically take a long time (even if eg. 15 seconds) to generate
proofs valid for other clients. This time would be long enough to
potentially create a temporary fork and disrupt the chain for a few
slots.</li>
<li><strong>Data inefficiency</strong>: one benefit of ZK-SNARKs is that
data that is only relevant to <em>verification</em> (sometimes called
"witness data") could be removed from a block. For example, once you've
verified a signature, you don't need to keep the signature in a block,
you could just store a single bit saying that the signature is valid,
along with a single proof in the block confirming that all of the valid
signatures exist. However, if we want it to be possible to generate
proofs of multiple types for a block, the original signatures would need
to actually be published.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latency challenge could be addressed by being careful when
designing the single-slot finality protocol. Single-slot finality
protocols will likely require more than two rounds of consensus per
slot, and so one could require the first round to include the block, and
only require nodes to verify proofs before signing in the third (or
final) round. This ensures that a significant time window is always
available between the deadline for publishing a block and the time when
it's expected for proofs to be available.</p>
<p>The data efficiency issue would have to be addressed by having a
separate protocol for aggregating verification-related data. For
signatures, we could use <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/adding-cross-transaction-bls-signature-aggregation-to-ethereum/7844">BLS
aggregation</a>, which <a
href="https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/pull/92">ERC-4337
already supports</a>. Another major category of verification-related
data is ZK-SNARKs <a href="../../../2022/06/15/using_snarks.html">used
for privacy</a>. Fortunately, these often tend to <a
href="../../../2021/11/05/halo.html">have their own aggregation
protocols</a>.</p>
<p>It is also worth mentioning that SNARK-verifying the layer 1 has an
important <em>benefit</em>: the fact that on-chain EVM execution no
longer needs to be verified by every node makes it possible to greatly
increase the amount of EVM execution taking place. This could happen
either by greatly increasing the layer 1 gas limit, or by introducing <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/vrx9xe/comment/if7auu7/">enshrined
rollups</a>, or both.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Making an open multi-client ZK-EVM ecosystem work well will take a
lot of work. But the really good news is that much of this work is
happening or will happen anyway:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync">We</a> have <a
href="https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zkevm-specs">multiple</a>
strong <a href="https://github.com/0xpolygonhermez">ZK-EVM</a>
implementations <a
href="https://github.com/sayajin-labs/kakarot">already</a>. These
implementations are not yet <a
href="../../../2022/08/04/zkevm.html">type 1</a> (fully
Ethereum-equivalent), but many of them are actively moving in that
direction.</li>
<li>The work on light clients such as <a
href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/building-helios-ethereum-light-client/">Helios</a>
and <a href="https://www.succinct.xyz/">Succinct</a> may eventually turn
into a more full SNARK-verification of the PoS consensus side of the
Ethereum chain.</li>
<li>Clients will likely start experimenting with ZK-EVMs to prove
Ethereum block execution on their own, especially once we have <a
href="https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2021/02/14/why-stateless.html">stateless
clients</a> and there's no technical need to directly re-execute every
block to maintain the state. We will probably get a slow and gradual
transition from clients verifying Ethereum blocks by re-executing them
to most clients verifying Ethereum blocks by checking SNARK proofs.</li>
<li>The ERC-4337 and PBS ecosystems are likely to start working with
aggregation technologies like BLS and proof aggregation pretty soon, in
order to save on gas costs. On BLS aggregation, <a
href="https://medium.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/bls-wallet-bundling-up-data-fb5424d3bdd3">work
has already started</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these technologies in place, the future looks very good.
Ethereum blocks would be smaller than today, anyone could run a fully
verifying node on their laptop or even their phone or inside a browser
extension, and this would all happen while preserving the benefits of
Ethereum's multi-client philosophy.</p>
<p>In the longer-term future, of course anything could happen. Perhaps
AI will super-charge formal verification to the point where it can
easily prove ZK-EVM implementations equivalent and identify all the bugs
that cause differences between them. Such a project may even be
something that could be practical to start working on now. If such a
formal verification-based approach succeeds, different mechanisms would
need to be put in place to ensure continued political decentralization
of the protocol; perhaps at that point, the protocol would be considered
"complete" and immutability norms would be stronger. But even if that is
the longer-term future, the open multi-client ZK-EVM world seems like a
natural stepping stone that is likely to happen anyway.</p>
<p>In the nearer term, this is still a long journey. ZK-EVMs
<em>are</em> here, but ZK-EVMs becoming truly viable at layer 1 would
require them to become type 1, and make proving fast enough that it can
happen in real time. With enough parallelization, this is doable, but it
will still be a lot of work to get there. Consensus changes like raising
the gas cost of KECCAK, SHA256 and other hash function precompiles will
also be an important part of the picture. That said, the first steps of
the transition may happen sooner than we expect: once we switch to <a
href="../../../2021/06/18/verkle.html">Verkle trees</a> and stateless
clients, clients could start gradually using ZK-EVMs, and a transition
to an "open multi-ZK-EVM" world could start happening all on its
own.</p>
