<title> Don't overload Ethereum's consensus </title>

<p><em>Special thanks to Karl Floersch and Justin Drake for feedback and
review</em></p>
<p>The Ethereum network's consensus is one of the most highly secured
cryptoeconomic systems out there. <a href="https://beaconcha.in/">18
million ETH</a> (~$34 billion) worth of validators finalize a block
every 6.4 minutes, running <a href="https://clientdiversity.org/">many
different implementations of the protocol</a> for redundancy. And if the
<em>cryptoeconomic</em> consensus fails, whether due to a bug or an
intentional 51% attack, a vast community of many thousands of developers
and many more users are watching carefully to make sure the chain
recovers correctly. Once the chain recovers, protocol rules ensure that
attackers will likely be heavily penalized.</p>
<p>Over the years there have been a number of ideas, usually at the
thought experiment stage, to also use the Ethereum validator set, and
perhaps even the Ethereum social consensus, <em>for other
purposes</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The ultimate oracle</strong>: <a
href="https://forum.gnosis.io/t/the-ultimate-oracle/61">a proposal</a>
where users can vote on what facts are true by sending ETH, with a <a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/03/28/schellingcoin-a-minimal-trust-universal-data-feed">SchellingCoin</a>
mechanism: everyone who sent ETH to vote for the majority answer gets a
proportional share of all the ETH sent to vote for the minority answer.
The description continues: "So in principle this is an symmetric game.
What breaks the symmetry is that a) the truth is the natural point to
coordinate on and more importantly b) the people betting on the truth
can make a credible thread of forking Ethereum if they loose."</li>
<li><strong>Re-staking</strong>: a set of techniques, used by many
protocols including <a
href="https://www.eigenlayer.xyz/">EigenLayer</a>, where Ethereum
stakers can simultaneously use their stake as a deposit in another
protocol. In some cases, if they misbehave according to the other
protocol's rules, their deposit also gets slashed. In other cases, there
are no in-protocol incentives and stake is simply used to vote.</li>
<li><strong>L1-driven recovery of L2 projects</strong>: it has been
proposed on many occasions that if an L2 has a bug, the L1 could fork to
recover it. One recent example is <a
href="https://stack.optimism.io/docs/understand/explainer/#unfreezing-the-bridge-via-l1-soft-fork">this
design for using L1 soft forks to recover L2 failures</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The purpose of this post will be to explain in detail the
argument why, in my view, <em>a certain subset</em> of these techniques
brings high systemic risks to the ecosystem and should be discouraged
and resisted.</strong></p>
<p>These proposals are generally made in a well-intentioned way, and so
the goal is not to focus on individuals or projects; rather, the goal is
to focus on techniques. The general rule of thumb that this post will
attempt to defend is as follows: <strong>dual-use of validator staked
ETH, while it has some risks, is fundamentally fine, but attempting to
"recruit" Ethereum social consensus for your application's own purposes
is not.</strong></p>
<h2
id="examples-of-the-distinction-between-re-using-validators-low-risk-and-overloading-social-consensus-high-risk">Examples
of the distinction between re-using validators (low-risk) and
overloading social consensus (high-risk)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Alice creates a web3 social network where if you cryptographically
prove that you control the key of an active Ethereum validator, you
automatically gain "verified" status.
<b style="color:#008800">Low-risk</b>.</li>
<li>Bob cryptographically proves that he controls the key of ten active
Ethereum validators as a way of proving that he has enough wealth to
satisfy some legal requirement.
<b style="color:#008800">Low-risk</b>.</li>
<li>Charlie claims to have disproven the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_prime">twin primes
conjecture</a>, and claims to know the largest <code>p</code> such that
<code>p</code> and <code>p+2</code> are both prime. He changes his
staking withdrawal address to a smart contract where anyone can submit a
claimed counterexample <code>q &gt; p</code>, along with a SNARK proving
that <code>q</code> and <code>q+2</code> are both prime. If someone
makes a valid claim, then Charlie's validator is forcibly exited, and
the submitter gets whatever of Charlie's ETH is left.
<b style="color:#008800">Low-risk</b>.</li>
<li>Dogecoin decides to switch to proof of stake, and to increase the
size of its security pool it allows Ethereum stakers to "dual-stake" and
simultaneously join its validator set. To do so, Ethereum stakers would
have to change their staking withdrawal address to a smart contract
where anyone can submit a proof that they violated the <em>Dogecoin
staking rules</em>. If someone does submit such a proof, then the
staker's validator is forcibly exited, and whatever of their ETH is left
is used to buy-and-burn DOGE.
<b style="color:#008800">Low-risk</b>.</li>
<li><a href="https://e.cash/">eCash</a> does the same as Dogecoin, but
the project leaders further announce: if the majority of participating
ETH validators collude to censor <em>eCash transactions</em>, they
expect that the Ethereum community will hard-fork to delete those
validators. They argue that it will be in Ethereum's interest to do so
as those validators are proven to be malicious and unreliable.
<b style="color:#ff0000">High-risk</b>.</li>
<li>Fred creates an ETH/USD price oracle, which functions by allowing
Ethereum validators to participate and vote. There are no incentives.
<b style="color:#008800">Low-risk</b>.</li>
<li>George creates an ETH/USD price oracle, which functions by allowing
ETH holders to participate and vote. To protect against laziness and
creeping bribes, they add an incentive mechanism where the participants
that give an answer within 1% of the median answer get 1% of the ETH of
any participants that gave an answer further than 1% from the median.
When asked "what if someone <a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/01/28/p-epsilon-attack">credibly
offers to bribe all the participants</a>, everyone starts submitting the
wrong answer, and so honest people get 10 million of their ETH taken
away?", George replies: then Ethereum will have to fork out the bad
participants' money. <b style="color:#ff0000">High-risk</b>.
<ul>
<li>George conspicuously stays away from making replies.
<b style="color:#ff8800">Medium-high risk</b> (as the project could
create incentives to attempt such a fork, and hence the expectation that
it will be attmpted, even without formal encouragement)</li>
<li>George replies: "then the attacker wins, and we'll give up on using
this oracle". <b style="color:#668800">Medium-low risk</b> (not quite
"low" only because the mechanism does create a large set of actors who
in a 51% attack might be incentivized to indepently advocate for a fork
to protect their deposits)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hermione creates a successful layer 2, and argues that because her
layer 2 is the largest, it is inherently the most secure, because if
there is a bug that causes funds to be stolen, the losses will be so
large that the community will have no choice but to fork to recover the
users' funds. <b style="color:#ff0000">High-risk</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're designing a protocol where, even if everything completely
breaks, the losses are kept contained to the validators and users who
opted in to participating in and using your protocol, this is low-risk.
If, on the other hand, you have the intent to rope in the broader
Ethereum ecosystem social consensus to fork or reorg to solve your
problems, this is high-risk, and I argue that we should strongly resist
all attempts to create such expectations.</p>
<p>A middle ground is situations that start off in the low-risk category
but give their participants incentives to slide into the higher-risk
category; <a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/03/28/schellingcoin-a-minimal-trust-universal-data-feed">SchellingCoin-style
techniques</a>, especially mechanisms with heavy penalties for deviating
from the majority, are a major example.</p>
<h2 id="so-whats-so-wrong-with-stretching-ethereum-consensus-anyway">So
what's so wrong with stretching Ethereum consensus, anyway?</h2>
<p>It is the year 2025. Frustrated with the existing options, a group
has decided to make a new ETH/USD price oracle, which works by allowing
validators to vote on the price every hour. If a validator votes, they
would be unconditionally rewarded with a portion of fees from the
system. But soon participants became lazy: they connected to centralized
APIs, and when those APIs got cyber-attacked, they either dropped out or
started reporting false values. To solve this, incentives were
introduced: the oracle also votes retrospectively on the price one week
ago, and if your (real time <em>or</em> retrospective) vote is more than
1% away from the median retrospective vote, you are heavily penalized,
with the penalty going to those who voted "correctly".</p>
<p>Within a year, over 90% of validators are participating. Someone
asked: what if Lido bands together with a few other large stakers to 51%
attack the vote, forcing through a fake ETH/USD price value, extracting
heavy penalties from everyone who does not participate in the attack?
The oracle's proponents, at this point heavily invested in the scheme,
reply: well if that happens, Ethereum will surely fork to kick the bad
guys out.</p>
<p>At first, the scheme is limited to ETH/USD, and it appears resilient
and stable. But over the years, other indices get added: ETH/EUR,
ETH/CNY, and eventually rates for all countries in the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20">G20</a>.</p>
<p>But in 2034, things start to go wrong. Brazil has an unexpectedly
severe political crisis, leading to a disputed election. One political
party ends up in control of the capital and 75% of the country, but
another party ends up in control of some northern areas. Major Western
media argue that the northern party is clearly the legitimate winner
because it acted legally and the southern party acted illegally (and by
the way are fascist). Indian and Chinese official sources, and Elon
Musk, argue that the southern party has actual control of most of the
country, and the international community should not try to be a world
police and should instead accept the outcome.</p>
<p>By this point, Brazil has a CBDC, which splits into two forks: the
(northern) BRL-N, and the (southern) BRL-S. When voting in the oracle,
60% of Ethereum stakers provide the ETH/BRL-S rate. Major community
leaders and businesses decry the stakers' craven capitulation to
fascism, and propose to fork the chain to only include the "good
stakers" providing the ETH/BRL-N rate, and drain the other stakers'
balances to near-zero. Within their social media bubble, they believe
that they will clearly win. However, once the fork hits, the BRL-S side
proves unexpectedly strong. What they expected to be a landslide instead
proves to be pretty much a 50-50 community split.</p>
<p>At this point, the two sides are in their two separate universes with
their two chains, with no practical way of coming back together.
Ethereum, a global permissionless platform created in part to be a
refuge from nations and geopolitics, instead ends up cleaved in half by
any one of the twenty G20 member states having an unexpectedly severe
internal issue.</p>
<h2
id="thats-a-nice-scifi-story-you-got-there.-could-even-make-a-good-movie.-but-what-can-we-actually-learn-from-it">That's
a nice scifi story you got there. Could even make a good movie. But what
can we actually learn from it?</h2>
<p>A blockchain's "purity", in the sense of it being a purely
mathematical construct that attempts to come to consensus only on purely
mathematical things, is a huge advantage. As soon as a blockchain tries
to "hook in" to the outside world, the outside world's conflicts start
to impact on the blockchain too. Given a sufficiently extreme political
event - in fact, not <em>that</em> extreme a political event, given that
the above story was basically a pastiche of events that have actually
happened in various major (&gt;25m population) countries all within the
past decade - even something as benign as a currency oracle could tear
the community apart.</p>
<p>Here are a few more possible scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the currencies that the oracle tracks (which could even be
USD) simply hyperinflates, and markets break down to the point that at
some points in time there is no clear specific market price.</li>
<li>If Ethereum adds a price oracle to <em>another cryptocurrency</em>,
then a controversial split like in the story above is not hypothetical:
it's something that has already happened, including in the histories of
both <a
href="https://www.investopedia.com/news/all-about-bitcoin-cash-hard-fork">Bitcoin</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum_Classic">Ethereum
itself</a>.</li>
<li>If strict capital controls become operational, then <em>which</em>
price to report as the legitimate market price between two currencies
becomes a political question.</li>
</ul>
<p>But more importantly, I'd argue that there is a Schelling fence at
play: once a blockchain <em>starts</em> incorporating real-world price
indices as a layer-1 protocol feature, it could easily succumb to
interpreting more and more real-world information. Introducing layer-1
price indices also expands the blockchain's legal attack surface:
instead of being <em>just</em> a neutral technical platform, it becomes
much more explicitly a financial tool.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-risks-from-examples-other-than-price-indices">What
about risks from examples other than price indices?</h2>
<p><em>Any</em> expansion of the "duties" of Ethereum's consensus
increases the costs, complexities and risks of running a validator.
Validators become required to take on the human effort of paying
attention and running and updating additional software to make sure that
they are acting correctly according to whatever other protocols are
being introduced. Other communities gain the ability to externalize
their dispute resolution needs onto the Ethereum community. Validators
and the Ethereum community as a whole become forced to make far more
decisions, each of which has some risk of causing a community split.
Even if there is no split, the desire to avoid such pressure creates
additional incentives to externalize the decisions to centralized
entities through stake-pooling.</p>
<p>The possibility of a split would also greatly strengthen perverse
too-big-to-fail mechanics. There are so many layer-2 and
application-layer projects on Ethereum that it would be impractical for
Ethereum social consensus to be willing to fork to solve <em>all</em> of
their problems. Hence, larger projects would inevitably get a larger
chance of getting a bailout than smaller ones. This would in turn lead
to larger projects getting a moat: would you rather have your coins on
Arbitrum or Optimism, where if something goes wrong Ethereum will fork
to save the day, or on <a href="https://taiko.xyz/">Taiko</a>, where
because it's smaller (and non-Western, hence less socially connected to
core dev circles), an L1-backed rescue is much less likely?</p>
<h2
id="but-bugs-are-a-risk-and-we-need-better-oracles.-so-what-should-we-do">But
bugs are a risk, and we need better oracles. So what should we do?</h2>
<p>The best solutions to these problems are, in my view, case-by-case,
because the various problems are inherently so different from each
other. Some solutions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Price oracles</strong>: either <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/a-not-quite-cryptoeconomic-decentralized-oracle/6453">not-quite-cryptoeconomic
decentralized oracles</a>, or validator-voting-based oracles that
<strong>explicitly commit to their emergency recovery strategies being
something other than appealing to L1 consensus</strong> for recovery (or
some combination of both). For example, a price oracle could count on a
trust assumption that voting participants get corrupted slowly, and so
users would have early warning of an attack and could exit any systems
that depend on the oracle. Such an oracle could intentionally give its
reward only after a long delay, so that if that instance of the protocol
falls into disuse (eg. because the oracle fails and the community forks
toward another version), the participants do not get the reward.</li>
<li><strong>More complex truth oracles</strong> reporting on facts more
subjective than price: some kind of decentralized court system built on
a <a href="../../../2022/09/20/daos.html">not-quite-cryptoeconomic
DAO</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Layer 2 protocols</strong>:
<ul>
<li>In the short term, rely on partial training wheels (what this post
calls <a
href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571">stage
1</a>)</li>
<li>In the medium term, rely on <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hfVzCWT6YI">multiple proving
systems</a>. Trusted hardware (eg. SGX) could be included here; I
strongly anti-endorse SGX-like systems as a <em>sole</em> guarantor of
security, but as a member of a 2-of-3 system they could be
valuable.</li>
<li>In the longer term, hopefully complex functionalities such as "EVM
validation" will themselves eventually be enshrined in the protocol</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cross-chain bridges</strong>: similar logic as oracles, but
also, try to minimize how much you rely on bridges at all: hold assets
on the chain where they originate and use atomic swap protocols to move
value between different chains.</li>
<li><strong>Using the Ethereum validator set to secure other
chains</strong>: one reason why the (safer) Dogecoin approach in the <a
href="#examples-of-the-distinction-between-re-using-validators-low-risk-and-overloading-social-consensus-high-risk">list
of examples above</a> might be insufficient is that while it does
protect against 51% <em>finality-reversion</em> attacks, it does not
protect against 51% <em>censorship</em> attacks. However, if you are
already relying on Ethereum validators, then one possible direction to
take is to move away from trying to manage an independent chain
entirely, and become a <a
href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/validium/">validium</a>
with proofs anchored into Ethereum. If a chain does this, its protection
against finality-reversion attacks becomes as strong as Ethereum's, and
it becomes secure against censorship up to 99% attacks (as opposed to
49%).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Blockchain communities' social consensus is a fragile thing. It's
necessary - because upgrades happen, bugs happen, and 51% attacks are
always a possibility - but because it has such a high risk of causing
chain splits, in mature communities it should be used sparingly. There
is a natural urge to try to extend the blockchain's core with more and
more functionality, because the blockchain's core has the largest
economic weight and the largest community watching it, but each such
extention makes the core itself more fragile.</p>
<p>We should be wary of application-layer projects taking actions that
risk increasing the "scope" of blockchain consensus to anything other
than verifying the core Ethereum protocol rules. It is natural for
application-layer projects to attempt such a strategy, and indeed such
ideas are often simply conceived without appreciation of the risks, but
its result can easily become very misaligned with the goals of the
community as a whole. Such a process has no limiting principle, and
could easily lead to a blockchain community having more and more
"mandates" over time, pushing it into an uncomfortable choice between a
high yearly risk of splitting and some kind of de-facto formalized
bureaucracy that has ultimate control of the chain.</p>
<p>We should instead preserve the chain's minimalism, support uses of
re-staking that do not look like slippery slopes to extending the role
of Ethereum consensus, and help developers find alternate strategies to
achieve their security goals.</p>
