<p><em>This is a mirror of the post at

class="citation"

<p>There has been a lot of interest lately in the technology behind
zk-SNARKs, and people are increasingly <a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/12/05/zksnarks-in-a-nutshell/">trying
to demystify</a> something that many have come to call "moon math" due
to its perceived sheer indecipherable complexity. zk-SNARKs are indeed
quite challenging to grasp, especially due to the sheer number of moving
parts that need to come together for the whole thing to work, but if we
break the technology down piece by piece then comprehending it becomes
simpler.</p>
<p>The purpose of this post is not to serve as a full introduction to
zk-SNARKs; it assumes as background knowledge that (i) you know what
zk-SNARKs are and what they do, and (ii) know enough math to be able to
reason about things like polynomials (if the statement <span
class="math inline">\(P(x) + Q(x) = (P + Q)(x)\)</span> , where <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> are polynomials, seems natural and
obvious to you, then you're at the right level). Rather, the post digs
deeper into the machinery behind the technology, and tries to explain as
well as possible the first half of the pipeline, as drawn by zk-SNARK
researcher Eran Tromer here:</p>
<p><img
src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*YD-ckgBfmmmRBCyVlhp8YQ.png"
class="padded" /></p>
<p>The steps here can be broken up into two halves. First, zk-SNARKs
cannot be applied to any computational problem directly; rather, you
have to convert the problem into the right "form" for the problem to
operate on. The form is called a "quadratic arithmetic program" (QAP),
and transforming the code of a function into one of these is itself
highly nontrivial. Along with the process for converting the code of a
function into a QAP is another process that can be run alongside so that
if you have an input to the code you can create a corresponding solution
(sometimes called "witness" to the QAP). After this, there is another
fairly intricate process for creating the actual "zero knowledge proof"
for this witness, and a separate process for verifying a proof that
someone else passes along to you, but these are details that are out of
scope for this post.</p>
<p>The example that we will choose is a simple one: proving that you
know the solution to a cubic equation: <span class="math inline">\(x^3 +
x + 5 = 35\)</span> (hint: the answer is <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span>). This problem is simple enough that
the resulting QAP will not be so large as to be intimidating, but
nontrivial enough that you can see all of the machinery come into
play.</p>
<p>Let us write out our function as follows:</p>
<pre><code>def qeval(x):
    y = x**3
    return x + y + 5</code></pre>
<p>The simple special-purpose programming language that we are using
here supports basic arithmetic (<span class="math inline">\(+\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(-\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\cdot\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(/\)</span>), constant-power exponentiation (<span
class="math inline">\(x^7\)</span> but not <span
class="math inline">\(x^y\)</span>) and variable assignment, which is
powerful enough that you can theoretically do any computation inside of
it (as long as the number of computational steps is bounded; no loops
allowed). Note that modulo (%) and comparison operators (<span
class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(&gt;\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\geq\)</span>) are NOT supported, as there is no
efficient way to do modulo or comparison directly in finite cyclic group
arithmetic (be thankful for this; if there was a way to do either one,
then elliptic curve cryptography would be broken faster than you can say
"binary search" and "Chinese remainder theorem").</p>
<p>You can extend the language to modulo and comparisons by providing
bit decompositions (eg. <span class="math inline">\(13 = 2^3 + 2^2 +
1\)</span>) as auxiliary inputs, proving correctness of those
decompositions and doing the math in binary circuits; in finite field
arithmetic, doing equality (==) checks is also doable and in fact a bit
easier, but these are both details we won't get into right now. We can
extend the language to support conditionals (eg. if <span
class="math inline">\(x &lt; 5: y = 7;\)</span> else: <span
class="math inline">\(y = 9\)</span>) by converting them to an
arithmetic form: <span class="math inline">\(y = 7 \cdot (x &lt; 5) + 9
\cdot (x \geq 5)\)</span> though note that both "paths" of the
conditional would need to be executed, and if you have many nested
conditionals then this can lead to a large amount of overhead.</p>
<p>Let us now go through this process step by step. If you want to do
this yourself for any piece of code, I <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/research/tree/master/zksnark">implemented
a compiler here</a> (for educational purposes only; not ready for making
QAPs for real-world zk-SNARKs quite yet!).</p>
<h2 id="flattening">Flattening</h2>
<p>The first step is a "flattening" procedure, where we convert the
original code, which may contain arbitrarily complex statements and
expressions, into a sequence of statements that are of two forms: <span
class="math inline">\(x = y\)</span> (where <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> can be a variable or a number) and
<span class="math inline">\(x = y\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\((op)\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> (where <span
class="math inline">\(op\)</span> can be <span
class="math inline">\(+\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(-\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\cdot\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(/\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> can be variables, numbers or themselves
sub-expressions). You can think of each of these statements as being
kind of like logic gates in a circuit. The result of the flattening
process for the above code is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>sym_1 = x * x
y = sym_1 * x
sym_2 = y + x
~out = sym_2 + 5</code></pre>
<p>If you read the original code and the code here, you can fairly
easily see that the two are equivalent.</p>
<h2 id="gates-to-r1cs">Gates to R1CS</h2>
<p>Now, we convert this into something called a rank-1 constraint system
(R1CS). An R1CS is a sequence of groups of three vectors (<span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span>), and the solution to an R1CS is a
vector <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> must satisfy the equation <span
class="math inline">\(s . a \cdot s . b - s . c = 0\)</span>, where
<span class="math inline">\(.\)</span> represents the dot product - in
simpler terms, if we "zip together" <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, multiplying the two values in the same
positions, and then take the sum of these products, then do the same to
<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and then <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, then the third result equals the
product of the first two results. For example, this is a satisfied
R1CS:</p>
<br>
<center>
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*wp6bmXoPEU_zZHzJFRq6IQ.png" class="padded" />
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>But instead of having just one constraint, we are going to have many
constraints: one for each logic gate. There is a standard way of
converting a logic gate into a <span class="math inline">\((a, b,
c)\)</span> triple depending on what the operation is (<span
class="math inline">\(+\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(-\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\cdot\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(/\)</span>) and whether the arguments are
variables or numbers. The length of each vector is equal to the total
number of variables in the system, including a dummy variable ~one at
the first index representing the number <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, the input variables, a dummy variable
~out representing the output, and then all of the intermediate variables
(<span class="math inline">\(sym_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(sym_2\)</span> above); the vectors are generally
going to be very sparse, only filling in the slots corresponding to the
variables that are affected by some particular logic gate.</p>
<p>First, we'll provide the variable mapping that we'll use:</p>
<pre><code>&#39;~one&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;~out&#39;, &#39;sym_1&#39;, &#39;y&#39;, &#39;sym_2&#39;</code></pre>
<p>The solution vector will consist of assignments for all of these
variables, in that order.</p>
<p>Now, we'll give the <span class="math inline">\((a, b, c)\)</span>
triple for the first gate:</p>
<pre><code>a = [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
b = [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
c = [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]</code></pre>
<p>You can see that if the solution vector contains <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span> in the second position, and <span
class="math inline">\(9\)</span> in the fourth position, then regardless
of the rest of the contents of the solution vector, the dot product
check will boil down to <span class="math inline">\(3 \cdot 3 =
9\)</span>, and so it will pass. If the solution vector has <span
class="math inline">\(-3\)</span> in the second position and <span
class="math inline">\(9\)</span> in the fourth position, the check will
also pass; in fact, if the solution vector has <span
class="math inline">\(7\)</span> in the second position and <span
class="math inline">\(49\)</span> in the fourth position then that check
will still pass — the purpose of this first check is to verify the
consistency of the inputs and outputs of the first gate only.</p>
<p>Now, let's go on to the second gate:</p>
<pre><code>a = [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
b = [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
c = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]</code></pre>
<p>In a similar style to the first dot product check, here we're
checking that <span class="math inline">\(sym_1 \cdot x =
y\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, the third gate:</p>
<pre><code>a = [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
b = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
c = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]</code></pre>
<p>Here, the pattern is somewhat different: it's multiplying the first
element in the solution vector by the second element, then by the fifth
element, adding the two results, and checking if the sum equals the
sixth element. Because the first element in the solution vector is
always one, this is just an addition check, checking that the output
equals the sum of the two inputs.</p>
<p>Finally, the fourth gate:</p>
<pre><code>a = [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
b = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
c = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]</code></pre>
<p>Here, we're evaluating the last check, ~out <span
class="math inline">\(= sym_2 + 5\)</span>. The dot product check works
by taking the sixth element in the solution vector, adding five times
the first element (reminder: the first element is <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, so this effectively means adding <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span>), and checking it against the third
element, which is where we store the output variable.</p>
<p>And there we have our R1CS with four constraints. The witness is
simply the assignment to all the variables, including input, output and
internal variables:</p>
<pre><code>[1, 3, 35, 9, 27, 30]</code></pre>
<p>You can compute this for yourself by simply "executing" the flattened
code above, starting off with the input variable assignment <span
class="math inline">\(x=3\)</span>, and putting in the values of all the
intermediate variables and the output as you compute them.</p>
<p>The complete R1CS put together is:</p>
<pre><code>A
[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

B
[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

C
[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]</code></pre>
<h2 id="r1cs-to-qap">R1CS to QAP</h2>
<p>The next step is taking this R1CS and converting it into QAP form,
which implements the exact same logic except using polynomials instead
of dot products. We do this as follows. We go 3from four groups of three
vectors of length six to six groups of three degree-3 polynomials, where
evaluating the polynomials at each <em>x coordinate</em> represents one
of the constraints. That is, if we evaluate the polynomials at <span
class="math inline">\(x=1\)</span>, then we get our first set of
vectors, if we evaluate the polynomials at <span
class="math inline">\(x=2\)</span>, then we get our second set of
vectors, and so on.</p>
<p>We can make this transformation using something called a <em>Lagrange
interpolation</em>. The problem that a Lagrange interpolation solves is
this: if you have a set of points (ie. <span class="math inline">\((x,
y)\)</span> coordinate pairs), then doing a Lagrange interpolation on
those points gives you a polynomial that passes through all of those
points. We do this by decomposing the problem: for each <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> coordinate, we create a polynomial that
has the desired <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> coordinate at
that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> coordinate and a <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> coordinate of <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> at all the other <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> coordinates we are interested in, and
then to get the final result we add all of the polynomials together.</p>
<p>Let's do an example. Suppose that we want a polynomial that passes
through <span class="math inline">\((1, 3), (2, 2)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\((3, 4)\)</span>. We start off by making a
polynomial that passes through <span class="math inline">\((1, 3), (2,
0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((3, 0)\)</span>. As it turns
out, making a polynomial that "sticks out" at <span
class="math inline">\(x=1\)</span> and is zero at the other points of
interest is easy; we simply do:</p>
<pre><code>(x - 2) * (x - 3)</code></pre>
<p>Which looks like this:</p>
<br>
<center>
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*wsBN9VA71EXm2L4EV-hwcw.png" />
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now, we just need to "rescale" it so that the height at x=1 is
right:</p>
<pre><code>(x - 2) * (x - 3) * 3 / ((1 - 2) * (1 - 3))</code></pre>
<p>This gives us:</p>
<pre><code>1.5 * x**2 - 7.5 * x + 9</code></pre>
<br>
<center>
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*8agIwBEX5YJ1HyZ4K5r5Gw.png" />
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>We then do the same with the other two points, and get two other
similar-looking polynomials, except that they "stick out" at <span
class="math inline">\(x=2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(x=3\)</span> instead of <span
class="math inline">\(x=1\)</span>. We add all three together and
get:</p>
<pre><code>1.5 * x**2 - 5.5 * x + 7</code></pre>
<br>
<center>
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*kAn6O2BcDOsMgSwRPvRfZA.png" />
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>With exactly the coordinates that we want. The algorithm as described
above takes <span class="math inline">\(O(n^3)\)</span> time, as there
are <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> points and each point
requires <span class="math inline">\(O(n^2)\)</span> time to multiply
the polynomials together; with a little thinking, this can be reduced to
<span class="math inline">\(O(n^2)\)</span> time, and with a lot more
thinking, using fast Fourier transform algorithms and the like, it can
be reduced even further — a crucial optimization when functions that get
used in zk-SNARKs in practice often have many thousands of gates.</p>
<p>Now, let's use Lagrange interpolation to transform our R1CS. What we
are going to do is take the first value out of every <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> vector, use Lagrange interpolation to
make a polynomial out of that (where evaluating the polynomial at <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span> gets you the first value of the <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> vector), repeat the process for the
first value of every <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> vector, and then repeat that process
for the second values, the third, values, and so on. For convenience
I'll provide the answers right now:</p>
<pre><code>A polynomials
[-5.0, 9.166, -5.0, 0.833]
[8.0, -11.333, 5.0, -0.666]
[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
[-6.0, 9.5, -4.0, 0.5]
[4.0, -7.0, 3.5, -0.5]
[-1.0, 1.833, -1.0, 0.166]

B polynomials
[3.0, -5.166, 2.5, -0.333]
[-2.0, 5.166, -2.5, 0.333]
[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

C polynomials
[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
[-1.0, 1.833, -1.0, 0.166]
[4.0, -4.333, 1.5, -0.166]
[-6.0, 9.5, -4.0, 0.5]
[4.0, -7.0, 3.5, -0.5]</code></pre>
<p>Coefficients are in ascending order, so the first polynomial above is
actually <span class="math inline">\(0.833 \cdot x^3 — 5 \cdot x^2 +
9.166 \cdot x - 5\)</span>. This set of polynomials (plus a Z polynomial
that I will explain later) makes up the parameters for this particular
QAP instance. Note that all of the work up until this point needs to be
done only once for every function that you are trying to use zk-SNARKs
to verify; once the QAP parameters are generated, they can be
reused.</p>
<p>Let's try evaluating all of these polynomials at <span
class="math inline">\(x=1\)</span>. Evaluating a polynomial at <span
class="math inline">\(x=1\)</span> simply means adding up all the
coefficients (as <span class="math inline">\(1^k = 1\)</span> for all
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>), so it's not difficult. We
get:</p>
<pre><code>A results at x=1
0
1
0
0
0
0

B results at x=1
0
1
0
0
0
0

C results at x=1
0
0
0
1
0
0</code></pre>
<p>And lo and behold, what we have here is exactly the same as the set
of three vectors for the first logic gate that we created above.</p>
<h2 id="checking-the-qap">Checking the QAP</h2>
<p>Now what's the point of this crazy transformation? The answer is that
instead of checking the constraints in the R1CS individually, we can now
check <em>all of the constraints at the same time</em> by doing the dot
product check <em>on the polynomials</em>.</p>

<p>Because in this case the dot product check is a series of additions
and multiplications of polynomials, the result is itself going to be a
polynomial. If the resulting polynomial, evaluated at every <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> coordinate that we used above to
represent a logic gate, is equal to zero, then that means that all of
the checks pass; if the resulting polynomial evaluated at at least one
of the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> coordinate representing a
logic gate gives a nonzero value, then that means that the values going
into and out of that logic gate are inconsistent (ie. the gate is <span
class="math inline">\(y = x \cdot sym_1\)</span> but the provided values
might be <span class="math inline">\(x = 2,sym_1 = 2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y = 5\)</span>).</p>
<p>Note that the resulting polynomial does not itself have to be zero,
and in fact in most cases won't be; it could have any behavior at the
points that don't correspond to any logic gates, as long as the result
is zero at all the points that <em>do</em> correspond to some gate. To
check correctness, we don't actually evaluate the polynomial <span
class="math inline">\(t = A . s \cdot B . s - C . s\)</span> at every
point corresponding to a gate; instead, we divide <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> by another polynomial, <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>, and check that <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> evenly divides <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> - that is, the division <span
class="math inline">\(t / Z\)</span> leaves no remainder.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> is defined as <span
class="math inline">\((x - 1) \cdot (x - 2) \cdot (x - 3) ...\)</span> -
the simplest polynomial that is equal to zero at all points that
correspond to logic gates. It is an elementary fact of algebra that
<em>any</em> polynomial that is equal to zero at all of these points has
to be a multiple of this minimal polynomial, and if a polynomial is a
multiple of <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> then its evaluation
at any of those points will be zero; this equivalence makes our job much
easier.</p>
<p>Now, let's actually do the dot product check with the polynomials
above. First, the intermediate polynomials:</p>
<pre><code>A . s = [43.0, -73.333, 38.5, -5.166]
B . s = [-3.0, 10.333, -5.0, 0.666]
C . s = [-41.0, 71.666, -24.5, 2.833]</code></pre>
<p>Now, <span class="math inline">\(A . s \cdot B . s — C .
s\)</span>:</p>
<pre><code>t = [-88.0, 592.666, -1063.777, 805.833, -294.777, 51.5, -3.444]</code></pre>
<p>Now, the minimal polynomial <span class="math inline">\(Z = (x - 1)
\cdot (x - 2) \cdot (x - 3) \cdot (x - 4)\)</span>:</p>
<pre><code>Z = [24, -50, 35, -10, 1]</code></pre>
<p>And if we divide the result above by <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>, we get:</p>
<pre><code>h = t / Z = [-3.666, 17.055, -3.444]</code></pre>
<p>With no remainder.</p>
<p>And so we have the solution for the QAP. If we try to falsify any of
the variables in the R1CS solution that we are deriving this QAP
solution from — say, set the last one to <span
class="math inline">\(31\)</span> instead of <span
class="math inline">\(30\)</span>, then we get a <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> polynomial that fails one of the checks
(in that particular case, the result at <span
class="math inline">\(x=3\)</span> would equal <span
class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> instead of <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span>), and furthermore <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> would not be a multiple of <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>; rather, dividing <span
class="math inline">\(t / Z\)</span> would give a remainder of <span
class="math inline">\([-5.0, 8.833, -4.5, 0.666]\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that the above is a simplification; "in the real world", the
addition, multiplication, subtraction and division will happen not with
regular numbers, but rather with finite field elements — a spooky kind
of arithmetic which is self-consistent, so all the algebraic laws we
know and love still hold true, but where all answers are elements of
some finite-sized set, usually integers within the range from <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> for some <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. For example, if <span
class="math inline">\(n = 13\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(1 / 2 = 7\)</span> (and <span
class="math inline">\(7 \cdot 2 = 1), 3 \cdot 5 = 2\)</span>, and so
forth. Using finite field arithmetic removes the need to worry about
rounding errors and allows the system to work nicely with elliptic
curves, which end up being necessary for the rest of the zk-SNARK
machinery that makes the zk-SNARK protocol actually secure.</p>

about the inner workings of zk-SNARKs to me.</p>
