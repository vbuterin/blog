<p>Systems like Ethereum (and Bitcoin, and NXT, and Bitshares, etc) are
a fundamentally new class of cryptoeconomic organisms — decentralized,
jurisdictionless entities that exist entirely in cyberspace, maintained
by a combination of cryptography, economics and social consensus. They
are kind of like BitTorrent, but they are also not like BitTorrent, as
BitTorrent has no concept of state — a distinction that turns out to be
crucially important. They are sometimes described as <a
href="https://letstalkbitcoin.com/is-bitcoin-overpaying-for-false-security">decentralized
autonomous corporations</a>, but they are also not quite corporations —
you can't hard fork Microsoft. They are kind of like open source
software projects, but they are not quite that either — you can fork a
blockchain, but not quite as easily as you can fork OpenOffice.</p>
<p>These cryptoeconomic networks come in many flavors — ASIC-based PoW,
GPU-based PoW, naive PoS, delegated PoS, hopefully soon Casper PoS — and
each of these flavors inevitably comes with its own underlying
philosophy. One well-known example is the maximalist vision of proof of
work, where "the" correct blockchain, singular, is defined as the chain
that miners have burned the largest amount of economic capital to
create. Originally a mere in-protocol fork choice rule, this mechanism
has in many cases been elevated to a sacred tenet — see <a
href="https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/687050458301657088">this
Twitter discussion between myself and Chris DeRose</a> for an example of
someone seriously trying to defend the idea in a pure form, even in the
face of hash-algorithm-changing protocol hard forks. Bitshares' <a
href="https://bitshares.org/technology/delegated-proof-of-stake-consensus/">delegated
proof of stake</a> presents another coherent philosophy, where
everything once again flows from a single tenet, but one that can be
described even more simply: <a
href="http://docs.bitshares.org/bitshares/dpos.html">shareholders
vote</a>.</p>
<p>Each of these philosophies; Nakamoto consensus, social consensus,
shareholder voting consensus, leads to its own set of conclusions and
leads to a system of values that makes quite a bit of sense when viewed
on its own terms — though they can certainly be criticized when compared
against each other. Casper consensus has a philosophical underpinning
too, though one that has so far not been as succinctly articulated.</p>
<p>Myself, Vlad, Dominic, Jae and others all have their own views on why
proof of stake protocols exist and how to design them, but here I intend
to explain where I personally am coming from.</p>
<p>I'll proceed to listing observations and then conclusions
directly.</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cryptography is truly special in the 21st century because
<strong>cryptography is one of the very few fields where adversarial
conflict continues to heavily favor the defender</strong>. Castles are
far easier to destroy than build, islands are defendable but can still
be attacked, but an average person's ECC keys are secure enough to
resist even state-level actors. Cypherpunk philosophy is fundamentally
about leveraging this precious asymmetry to create a world that better
preserves the autonomy of the individual, and cryptoeconomics is to some
extent an extension of that, except this time protecting the safety and
liveness of complex systems of coordination and collaboration, rather
than simply the integrity and confidentiality of private messages.
<strong>Systems that consider themselves ideological heirs to the
cypherpunk spirit should maintain this basic property, and be much more
expensive to destroy or disrupt than they are to use and
maintain.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>The "cypherpunk spirit" isn't just about idealism; making systems
that are easier to defend than they are to attack is also simply sound
engineering.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>On medium to long time scales, humans are quite good at
consensus</strong>. Even if an adversary had access to unlimited hashing
power, and came out with a 51% attack of any major blockchain that
reverted even the last month of history, convincing the community that
this chain is legitimate is much harder than just outrunning the main
chain's hashpower. They would need to subvert block explorers, every
trusted member in the community, the New York Times, archive.org, and
many other sources on the internet; all in all, convincing the world
that the new attack chain is the one that came first in the information
technology-dense 21st century is about as hard as convincing the world
that the US moon landings never happened. <strong>These social
considerations are what ultimately protect any blockchain in the long
term</strong>, regardless of whether or not the blockchain's community
admits it (<a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoinxt/comments/41pbmf/maxwell_considers_changing_the_pow_algorithm_in/">note
that</a> Bitcoin Core <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3fg0jw/could_a_cartel_of_pool_operators_collude_to/ctoat0d/">does
admit</a> this primacy of the social layer).</p></li>
<li><p>However, a blockchain protected by social consensus alone would
be far too inefficient and slow, and too easy for disagreements to
continue without end (though despite all difficulties, <a
href="http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2011/02/15/131934618/the-island-of-stone-money">it
has happened</a>); hence, <strong>economic consensus serves an extremely
important role in protecting liveness and safety properties in the short
term.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Because proof of work security can only come from block rewards
(in Dominic Williams' terms, it <a
href="https://twitter.com/dominic_w/status/648330685963370496">lacks two
of the three Es</a>), and incentives to miners can only come from the
risk of them losing their future block rewards, <strong>proof of work
necessarily operates on a logic of massive power incentivized into
existence by massive rewards</strong>. Recovery from attacks in PoW is
very hard: the first time it happens, you can hard fork to change the
PoW and thereby render the attacker's ASICs useless, but the second time
you no longer have that option, and so the attacker can attack again and
again. Hence, the size of the mining network has to be so large that
attacks are inconceivable. Attackers of size less than X are discouraged
from appearing by having the network constantly spend X every single
day. <strong>I reject this logic because (i) it <a
href="http://digiconomist.net/beci">kills trees</a>, and (ii) it fails
to realize the cypherpunk spirit — cost of attack and cost of defense
are at a 1:1 ratio, so there is no defender's
advantage</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proof of stake breaks this symmetry by relying not on
rewards for security, but rather penalties</strong>. Validators put
money ("deposits") at stake, are rewarded slightly to compensate them
for locking up their capital and maintaining nodes and taking extra
precaution to ensure their private key safety, but the bulk of the cost
of reverting transactions comes from penalties that are hundreds or
thousands of times larger than the rewards that they got in the
meantime. <strong>The "one-sentence philosophy" of proof of stake is
thus not "security comes from burning energy", but rather "security
comes from putting up economic value-at-loss"</strong>. A given block or
state has $X security if you can prove that achieving an equal level of
finalization for any conflicting block or state cannot be accomplished
unless malicious nodes complicit in an attempt to make the switch pay $X
worth of in-protocol penalties.</p></li>
<li><p>Theoretically, a majority collusion of validators may take over a
proof of stake chain, and start acting maliciously. However, (i) through
clever protocol design, their ability to earn extra profits through such
manipulation can be limited as much as possible, and more importantly
(ii) if they try to prevent new validators from joining, or execute 51%
attacks, then the community can simply coordinate a hard fork and delete
the offending validators' deposits. <strong>A successful attack may cost
$50 million, but the process of cleaning up the consequences will not be
<em>that </em>much more onerous than the <a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/11/25/security-alert-11242016-consensus-bug-geth-v1-4-19-v1-5-2/">geth/parity
consensus failure of 2016.11.25</a></strong>. Two days later, the
blockchain and community are back on track, attackers are $50 million
poorer, and the rest of the community is likely richer since the attack
will have caused the value of the token to go <em>up</em> due to the
ensuing supply crunch. <em>That's</em> attack/defense asymmetry for
you.</p></li>
<li><p>The above should not be taken to mean that unscheduled hard forks
will become a regular occurrence; if desired, the cost of a
<em>single</em> 51% attack on proof of stake can certainly be set to be
as high as the cost of a <em>permanent</em> 51% attack on proof of work,
and the sheer cost and ineffectiveness of an attack should ensure that
it is almost never attempted in practice.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Economics is not everything</strong>. Individual actors
may be motivated by extra-protocol motives, they may get hacked, they
may get kidnapped, or they may simply get drunk and decide to wreck the
blockchain one day and to hell with the cost. Furthermore, on the bright
side, <strong>individuals' moral forbearances and communication
inefficiencies will often raise the cost of an attack to levels much
higher than the nominal protocol-defined value-at-loss</strong>. This is
an advantage that we cannot rely on, but at the same time it is an
advantage that we should not needlessly throw away.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hence, the best protocols are protocols that work well
under a variety of models and assumptions </strong>— economic
rationality with coordinated choice, economic rationality with
individual choice, simple fault tolerance, Byzantine fault tolerance
(ideally both the adaptive and non-adaptive adversary variants), <a
href="https://www.amazon.ca/Honest-Truth-About-Dishonesty-Everyone-Especially/dp/0062183613">Ariely/Kahneman-inspired
behavioral economic models</a> ("we all cheat just a little") and
ideally any other model that's realistic and practical to reason about.
<strong>It is important to have both layers of defense: economic
incentives to discourage centralized cartels from acting anti-socially,
and anti-centralization incentives to discourage cartels from forming in
the first place.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consensus protocols that work as-fast-as-possible have
risks and should be approached very carefully if at all</strong>,
because if the <em>possibility</em> to be very fast is tied to
<em>incentives</em> to do so, the combination will reward very high and
systemic-risk-inducing levels of <strong>network-level
centralization</strong> (eg. all validators running from the same
hosting provider). Consensus protocols that don't care too much how fast
a validator sends a message, as long as they do so within some
acceptably long time interval (eg. 4–8 seconds, as we empirically know
that latency in ethereum is usually ~500ms-1s) do not have these
concerns. A possible middle ground is creating protocols that can work
very quickly, but where mechanics similar to Ethereum's uncle mechanism
ensure that the marginal reward for a node increasing its degree of
network connectivity beyond some easily attainable point is fairly
low.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>From here, there are of course many details and many ways to diverge
on the details, but the above are the core principles that at least my
version of Casper is based on. From here, we can certainly debate
tradeoffs between competing values . Do we give ETH a 1% annual issuance
rate and get an $50 million cost of forcing a remedial hard fork, or a
zero annual issuance rate and get a $5 million cost of forcing a
remedial hard fork? When do we increase a protocol's security under the
economic model in exchange for decreasing its security under a fault
tolerance model? Do we care more about having a predictable level of
security or a predictable level of issuance? These are all questions for
another post, and the various ways of <em>implementing</em> the
different tradeoffs between these values are questions for yet more
posts. But we'll get to it :)</p>
