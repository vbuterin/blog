<title> Degen communism: the only correct political ideology </title>

<p>In 2024, there is a widespread feeling throughout the Western world
that all of our political ideologies are outdated, and are increasingly
failing us. Old ideas that have dominated elite political thought,
whether capitalism or liberalism or progressive social democracy or
whatever else, are rapidly losing popularity. The capitalists <a
href="https://prosperousamerica.org/elon-musk-united-auto-workers-agree-tariffs-needed-to-save-american-car-industry/">are
supporting tariffs</a>. The libertarians are pushing to ban lab-grown
meat, and are actively <a
href="https://twitter.com/LPNH/status/1753776356809163261/quotes">railing
against the few in their ranks</a> who still remember that
libertarianism is supposed to be about liberty. The "new authoritarians"
of the world, meanwhile, are hardly presenting an attractive
alternative.</p>
<p>Some are trying to respond to this crisis by reminding us of the
virtues of the old ideals of civility and decorum, hoping that we could
wind back the clock and return to them. My friend Dennis Pourteaux is a
good example of this kind of mentality:</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><a
href="https://twitter.com/pourteaux/status/1774592680418541747"><img
src="../../../../images/dc/decorum.png" /></a></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>The problem is that this is a fundamentally reactionary mentality,
and it fails for the exact same reasons why all other reactionary
mentalities fail. If before we were at political equilibrium A, and
today we are at political equilibrium B, then that alone is strong
evidence that A is unstable, and even if you somehow force a transition
back to A, the likely outcome is that we'll come right back to B
again.</p>
<p>As much as defenders of the ancien regime might wish otherwise,
pre-internet old guard elite notions of respectability and decorum are
simply fundamentally incompatible with the world as it stands in the
2020s. And so instead of trying to look backward, we need to look
forward. So what is the forward-looking ideology that solves these
problems? <strong>Degen communism</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-degen-communism">What is degen communism?</h2>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/dc/cthulhuhalo.png" /></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>What does the internet of the 2020s - not the "respectable" internet
of Substack, not a hypothetical version of Twitter where the bad people
and somehow only the bad people are censored, but the real internet as
it exists today - fundamentally want? The answer is, it wants
<em>chaos</em>. <strong>It does not want gentle debates between
professionals who "disagree on policy but agree on civics". It wants
decisive action and risk, in all its glory</strong>. Not a world with
genteel respect for principles, where even the loser peacefully accepts
defeat because they understand that even if they lose one day they may
still win the next, but a world with great warriors who are willing to
bet their entire life savings and reputation on one single move that
reflects their deepest <em>conviction</em> on what things need to be
done. And it wants a world where the brave have the <em>freedom</em> to
take such risks.</p>
<p>At the same time, <strong>the general welfare of humanity demands a
greater focus on the common good</strong>. We've seen too many instances
of epic collapses, orchestrated by failed machinations of the elites,
where the common people end up screwed but the elites remain immune or
even benefit. The 2008 financial crisis was itself an example of this.
Rapid advances in technology, and rapid openings in immigration and
trade, leave most people better off, but often leave jobless those who
are not in a good position to adjust. Rapidly growing tech companies"
disrupt" old extractive elites, but then quickly <a
href="https://www.ft.com/content/6fb1602d-a08b-4a8c-bac0-047b7d64aba5">become
extractive elites themselves</a>. But most proponents of the common good
associate the common good with extreme notions of "social stability",
which are often an excuse for keeping <em>old</em> extractive elites
entrenched, and in any case are lame and incompatible with the trends of
the 21st century. Like the occasional forest fire and its <a
href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/ecological-benefits-fire/">positive
effects on antifragility of natural ecosystems</a>, chaos is the mother
of revitalization and renewal.</p>
<p>This brings me to the <strong>core idea of degen communism: a
political ideology that openly embraces chaos, but tweaks key rules and
incentives to create a background pressure where the consequences of
chaos are aligned with the common good</strong>.</p>
<p>Degen communist ideas can be adopted by any type of entity with a
network effect: crypto projects, social media sites, virtual game
environments and governments. Many of the core ideas are common across
all of these categories.</p>
<h2
id="cryptocurrency-the-avant-garde-in-degen.-can-it-become-degen-communist">Cryptocurrency:
the avant garde in degen. Can it become degen communist?</h2>
<p>The world of cryptocurrencies is one of the sectors of society that
embraces the "degen" the most. It has ups and downs that are unseen in
almost any other market. Meanwhile, the actual <em>effects</em> of the
downs are often smaller than they seem, which is why the space has not
collapsed completely. A 90% price drop erases billions of dollars of
value, but the average dollar lost is only lost in mark-to-market
book-value terms: it's people to held on the way up, and kept holding on
the way down. The average coin lost from a <a
href="https://blockworks.co/news/biggest-defi-hacks-2023">$100 million
defi hack</a> is a coin that was worth ten times less two years earlier.
Sometimes, the unpredictable chaos also does good: many memecoins have
donated significant amounts to charity.</p>
<p>But even still, when the prices crash, especially due to sudden
failures of projects that promised their users stability, too many
people get hurt. Could we create a world where the chaos remains, but
the <em>human</em> harm that comes from the downfalls is 10x smaller?
Here, I will resurrect an idea that I supported during the Terra/Luna
collapse of 2022:</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><a
href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1525561624974700545"><img
src="../../../../images/dc/terra.png" /></a></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>When projects collapse or get hacked, and only partial
refunds are possible, don't make the refunds proportional. Instead, make
smaller users whole first, up to some threshold (eg. $50k).</strong> Two
years ago, when I proposed this idea, many treated it with scorn, <a
href="https://twitter.com/nemoraliaa/status/1527095139029884928">misrepresenting</a>
the <a
href="https://twitter.com/flufferbot01/status/1526198238323277825">idea</a>
as <a
href="https://twitter.com/Xentagz/status/1526278392714350593">asking</a>
for <em><a
href="https://twitter.com/DumpTruckCap/status/1526228528747925505">government</a></em>
bailouts. Today, nobody seems to care about principles anymore, and so
even versions of this idea that <em>are</em> government-backed can
perhaps more easily get adopted. Here, though, I am not proposing
anything to do with governments; rather, I am proposing that project
teams put into their terms of service an expectation that in the event
of project insolvency, partial refunds will be prioritized in this way.
The only request to governments is that appropriate rules get passed so
that bankruptcy courts acknowledge the legitimacy of such
arrangements.</p>
<p>This mitigates the downsides of chaos toward the most vulnerable.
Now, what about better capturing the <em>upsides</em> of chaos? Here, I
support a combination of steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Memecoins and games can <a
href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/03/29/memecoins.html"><strong>donate
a portion of their issuance to charity</strong></a>.</li>
<li>Projects can use <strong>airdrops</strong> that try their best to
distribute the most to individual users, as well as public good
contributors such as open source software developers, solo stakers, etc.
The <a
href="https://www.starknet.io/en/content/starknet-provisions-program">Starknet
airdrop</a> was an <em>excellent</em> demonstration of this, as were
other egalitarian airdrops like the <a
href="https://dune.com/hildobby/ENS-Airdrop">ENS airdrop</a>.</li>
<li>Projects can have <strong>public goods funding programs</strong>
(whether proactive or retroactive). The first three rounds of <a
href="https://vote.optimism.io/retropgf/3">optimism retro funding</a>
were an excellent example; more projects should replicate this
model.</li>
<li>If a governance token gets too concentrated, and the concentrated
players make bad decisions, the community should be more willing to
<strong>fork the project and zero out the tokens of the concentrated
players who made the bad decisions</strong>. This was done most
successfully in the <a
href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html#coins-can-be-owned-by-social-contracts">Hive
fork of Steem</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these ideas, especially those that depend on some notion of
"per-person", would have been very difficult to reliably administer in
2019. In 2024, however, we have more and more robust proof of personhood
protocols, proofs of community participation such as POAPs, and reusable
lists such as <a
href="https://github.com/starknet-io/provisions-data/tree/main/eth">Starkware's
list of solo stakers</a> that they used for their airdrop. Hence,
<strong>a degen communist future for crypto is very
possible</strong>.</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/dc/meme.jpeg" /></p>
<p><small><i>The solution is to merge the two together. Keep the base
instinct, <strong>especially</strong> the base instinct of enjoying
watching things blow up, but tilt it toward the common good. In
exchange, the base instinct people can enjoy greater <a
href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html">legitimacy</a>.</i></small></p>
<p><small><i>Incidentally, maybe <strong>this</strong> is why that L2 is
called "Base".</i></small></p>

<h2 id="what-might-degen-communism-look-like-in-government-policy">What
might degen communism look like in government policy?</h2>
<p>The two main forms of chaos in the broader world are <strong>social
media</strong> and <strong>markets</strong>. Rather than trying to
defang both, we should embrace both (especially markets), and try to
tilt them toward more often serving the common good. Politics is
inherently a more slow-moving domain, so the proposals will seem 10x
milder. However, the increased scale of their impact more than makes up
for it.</p>

<p>Today, real estate markets in many parts of the developed world are
in crisis. In the most expensive regions, wealthy landowners earn
millions by simply holding on to pieces of real estate that they
acquired at dirt-cheap prices more than half a century ago. Rules like
<a
href="https://www.nber.org/digest/apr05/lock-effect-californias-proposition-13">California's
Proposition 13</a> mean that they only have to pay property taxes
calculated as though their plot still had a much lower price. At the
same time, many of these same people <a
href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-03-14/urban-planner-decries-brisbane-nimbyism/103582718">push
to maintain restrictive regulations</a> that prevent more dense housing
from being built. This is a society that favors the rich. Traditional
leftists' favorite countermeasure, rent control rules, only benefit
people who stay in the same place for many years, at the expense of <a
href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20160517-this-is-one-city-where-youll-never-find-a-home">very
long waits</a> for new people who want to come in. Meanwhile,
governments' ability to raise revenue to fund public services is limited
by the fact that if income and sales taxes are pushed too high, <a
href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/leaving-rich-americans-ditching-california-163000441.html">people
simply go</a> somewhere <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/10/super-rich-abandoning-norway-at-record-rate-as-wealth-tax-rises-slightly">else</a>.</p>
<p>This status quo is the exact opposite of degen, and the opposite of
communist. And so a degen communist will seek to overturn all parts of
it. Instead of focusing on taxing income and business, which can flee a
state or country that taxes it too heavily, we would put the primary tax
burden on <em>land</em>, which cannot. <a
href="https://www.landisabigdeal.com/">Land value taxes</a>, a yearly
property tax proportional on the value of <em>land</em> (but not the
buildings on the land), have been broadly supported by many economists
for over a century. We can add per-person exemptions, limiting the
effects of the tax on the most vulnerable: <strong>if we send half the
entire revenue from a land value tax directly into a per-person
dividend, then anyone who owns less than half the average amount of land
(ie. almost all poor people) would net-benefit</strong>!</p>
<p>This could be viewed as a market-based tax plus a dividend, or it can
be viewed as a rationing scheme, where if you own less land than your
quota you can get a reward by renting your excess quota to people who
own more.</p>
<p>A degen communist would also repeal restrictive rules that heavily
limit what can be built on the land, allowing much more construction to
take place. There are already places in the world that follow something
close to this approach: much of East Asia and, surprisingly, <a
href="https://twitter.com/DocumentingATX/status/1764631328723460247">Austin,
Texas</a>.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Housing supply growth in Austin <a
href="https://twitter.com/DKThomp/status/1769711918095163489">is fast,
and rents are dropping</a>. Texas does not have a land value tax, but it
has high property taxes: <a
href="https://smartasset.com/taxes/texas-property-tax-calculator">1.77%
per year</a>, compared to <a
href="https://smartasset.com/taxes/california-property-tax-calculator#8S9cyxsxpY">0.7%
per year in much of California</a>. Texas taxes its rich - but it taxes
their land, not their income. And it taxes stasis, rather than dynamism,
and in doing so it makes itself more affordable to the poor.</p>
<p>Many today are suffering from high prices - so let's drop the prices
we <em>can</em> drop (most notably, rent) with a few simple policy
changes.</p>
<h3 id="harberger-taxes-on-intellectual-property">Harberger taxes on
intellectual property</h3>
<p>So-called "intellectual property" (ie. copyrights and patents) is one
of the most elite-controlled forms of "property" around, and one of the
forms of government regulation most harmful to dynamism. On the other
hand, many are concerned that removing intellectual property entirely
would overly harm the incentive to innovate and make artistic works. To
strike a balance, I propose a happy medium: <strong>we keep copyrights
and patents, but put <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harberger_Tax">Harberger taxes</a>
on them</strong>.</p>
<p>This would work as follows. For a copyright or patent to be valid,
whoever owns it must publicly register a value, which we will call that
copyright or patent's "exclusivity price". They must then pay 2% of the
exclusivity price annually in tax (they can change the exclusivity price
at any time). Anyone can pay the owner the exclusivity price, and get an
unlimited right to also use (and if they wish sub-license, including to
the entire world) that copyright or patent. The original owner would
retain the right to use in all cases; others can gain permission to use
either by getting the original owner's permission, or by paying the
owner the exclusivity price.</p>
<p>This accomplishes two goals. First, <strong>it fixes
defaults</strong>: if someone has no interest in making money off of
keeping an invention or work exclusive, it sets the default so that it's
publicly available for anyone. Second, <strong>it leads to more
permissionlessness, and less exclusion, on the margin</strong>, by
putting a price on exclusion. The revenues from this tax could go into a
citizen's dividend, or they could go into a <a
href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html">quadratic
funding pool</a> that supports non-profit science and art.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful and deeply good ideas in early communism is
the internationalism: the focus on "workers of the world uniting" and
songs like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Internationale">The
Internationale</a>. In 2024, we are unfortunately in an age of rising
nationalism, where it's considered normal for each nation to only care
about each own citizens, at the expense of people unlucky enough to be
born outside. Faced with these restrictions, some are taking matters
into their own hands, making their way into wealthy countries the
old-fashioned way - the way that pretty much everyone did up until
globalist schemes of social control like passports <a
href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/a-history-of-the-passport">were
introduced about a century ago</a>.</p>
<p>A degen communist would embrace dynamism and change, especially when
it seems like such dynamism and change might <a
href="https://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2014/05/how-migration-liberalization-might.html">benefit
the global poor more than anyone else</a>. Degen communists would
greatly expand safe and legal pathways for people to visit and live
where they want to visit and live, trusting in liberalized housing
construction, plus governments made wealthy by taxes from such
construction, to build needed infrastructure for them. Restrictions
would be focused on keeping out <em>particularly risky or bad
actors</em>, rather than keeping out <em>almost everyone</em>. A "proof
of stake" scheme could be adopted where someone can put down funds (or
the right to make future invitations) at stake on a claim that a given
person will not break any rules, which would then give that person an
automatic right to enter. Security can be improved while total freedom
of movement is increased.</p>
<h2 id="decision-making-in-degen-communism">Decision-making in degen
communism</h2>
<p>Decision-making in degen communist institutions would be democratic,
and would follow three equally important principles:
<strong>dynamism</strong>, <strong>cross-tribal bridging</strong> and
<strong>quality</strong>. Decisions could be made quickly, using
algorithms that identify ideas that are held in common across groups
which normally disagree with each other, and which elevate quality
without entrenching a fixed set of elites.</p>
<p>This involves a two-layer stack:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public discussion and consensus-finding platforms</strong>,
which can allow large groups of people to rapidly participate but
include mechanisms to identify points of consensus. This includes tools
such as <a href="https://pol.is/home">pol.is</a> and <a
href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/08/16/communitynotes.html">Community
Notes</a>, which focus on cross-tribal bridging. It also includes
prediction markets (eg. <a
href="https://polymarket.com/">Polymarket</a>), which in addition to
helping communities surface good predictions, serve the role of giving
intellectuals an outlet to express their conviction about their
strongest and most fervent beliefs - and for others to bet against
them.</li>
<li><strong>The final governance mechanism (eg. voting)</strong>. This
can use quadratic voting, though the "cross-tribal bridging"
functionality can be enhanced by ideas like the matrix-factoring
algorithm in Community Notes or by <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/pairwise-coordination-subsidies-a-new-quadratic-funding-design/5553">pairwise-bounded
quadratic voting</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two sets of tools together allow decisions to be made quickly,
at large scale, and in a way that favors quality in a dynamic way that
allows experts to quickly rise and fall with each individual topic or
decision.</p>
<p>In all of these possible implementations, the core theme of degen
communism is the same. Do not try to enforce stasis. Instead, embrace
the chaos of markets and other fast-paced human activity. At the same
time, however, tweak rules in such a way that the upsides get funneled
into supporting public goods (including quality of the governance
itself), and the downsides get capped or even outright removed for the
people who are not able to handle it. This can be a way forward for
everyone in the 21st century.</p>
