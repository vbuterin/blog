<title> Engineering Security Through Coordination Problems </title>

<p>Recently, there was a small spat between the Core and Unlimited
factions of the Bitcoin community, a spat which represents perhaps the
fiftieth time the same theme was debated, but which is nonetheless
interesting because of how it highlights a very subtle philosophical
point about how blockchains work.</p>
<p>ViaBTC, a mining pool that favors Unlimited, <a
href="https://i.redd.it/x9f7t3rhn4wy.png">tweeted</a> "hashpower is
law", a usual talking point for the Unlimited side, which believes that
miners have, and should have, a very large role in the governance of
Bitcoin, the usual argument for this being that miners are the one
category of users that has a large and illiquid financial incentive in
Bitcoin's success. Greg Maxwell (from the Core side) <a
href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/69t452/viabtc_comment_to_the_recent_segwit_pool/dh95hat/">replied</a>
that "Bitcoin's security works precisely because hash power is NOT
law".</p>
The Core argument is that miners only have a limited role in the Bitcoin
system, to secure the ordering of transactions, and they should NOT have
the power to determine anything else, including block size limits and
other block validity rules. These constraints are enforced by full nodes
run by users - if miners start producing blocks according to a set of
rules different than the rules that users' nodes enforce, then the
users' nodes will simply reject the blocks, regardless of whether 10% or
60% or 99% of the hashpower is behind them. To this, Unlimited often
replies with something like "if 90% of the hashpower is behind a new
chain that increases the block limit, and the old chain with 10%
hashpower is now ten times slower for five months until difficulty
readjusts, would you <em>really</em> not update your client to accept
the new chain?" <br>
<hr />
<p><br> Many people often <a
href="http://www.ofnumbers.com/2015/07/27/what-is-permissioned-on-permissionless/">argue</a>
<a
href="http://www.multichain.com/blog/2015/11/smart-contracts-good-bad-lazy/">against</a>
the use of public blockchains for applications that involve real-world
assets or anything with counterparty risk. The critiques are either
total, saying that there is no point in implementing such use cases on
public blockchains, or partial, saying that while there may be
advantages to storing the <em>data</em> on a public chain, the
<em>business logic</em> should be executed off chain.</p>
The argument usually used is that in such applications, points of trust
exist already - there is someone who owns the physical assets that back
the on-chain permissioned assets, and that someone could always choose
to run away with the assets or be compelled to freeze them by a
government or bank, and so managing the digital representations of these
assets on a blockchain is like paying for a reinforced steel door for
one's house when the window is open. Instead, such systems should use
private chains, or even traditional server-based solutions, perhaps
adding bits and pieces of cryptography to improve auditability, and
thereby save on the inefficiencies and costs of putting everything on a
blockchain. <br>
<hr />
<p><br> The arguments above are both flawed in their pure forms, and
they are flawed in a similar way. While it is <em>theoretically
possible</em> for miners to switch 99% of their hashpower to a chain
with new rules (to make an example where this is uncontroversially bad,
suppose that they are increasing the block reward), and even <a
href="https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/827783678910558208">spawn-camp</a>
the old chain to make it permanently useless, and it is also
theoretically possible for a centralized manager of an asset-backed
currency to cease honoring one digital token, make a new digital token
with the same balances as the old token except with one particular
account's balance reduced to zero, and start honoring the new token, in
practice <em>those things are both quite hard to do</em>.</p>
<p>In the first case, users will have to realize that something is wrong
with the existing chain, agree that they should go to the new chain that
the miners are now mining on, and download the software that accepts the
new rules. In the second case, all clients and applications that depend
on the original digital token will break, users will need to update
their clients to switch to the new digital token, and smart contracts
with no capacity to look to the outside world and see that they need to
update will break entirely. In the middle of all this, opponents of the
switch can create a fear-uncertainty-and-doubt campaign to try to
convince people that maybe they shouldn't update their clients after
all, or update their client to some <em>third</em> set of rules (eg.
changing proof of work), and this makes implementing the switch even
more difficult.</p>
<p>Hence, we can say that in both cases, even though there theoretically
are centralized or quasi-centralized parties that could force a
transition from state A to state B, where state B is disagreeable to
users but preferable to the centralized parties, doing so requires
<strong>breaking through a hard coordination problem</strong>.
Coordination problems are everywhere in society and are often a bad
thing - while it would be better for most people if the English language
got rid of its highly complex and irregular spelling system and made a
phonetic one, or if the United States switched to metric, or if we could
immediately <a href="http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/6088.html">drop all
prices and wages by ten percent in the event of a recession</a>, in
practice this requires everyone to agree on the switch at the same time,
and this is often very very hard.</p>
<p>With blockchain applications, however, we are doing something
different: <strong>we are using coordination problems to our
advantage</strong>, using the friction that coordination problems create
as a bulwark against malfeasance by centralized actors. We can build
systems that have property X, and we can guarantee that they will
preserve property X to a high degree because changing the rules from X
to not-X would require a whole bunch of people to agree to update their
software at the same time. Even if there is an actor that could force
the change, doing so would be hard. This is the kind of security that
you gain from client-side validation of blockchain consensus rules.</p>
Note that this kind of security relies on the decentralization of users
specifically. Even if there is only one miner in the world, there is
still a difference between a cryptocurrency mined by that miner and a
PayPal-like centralized system. In the latter case, the operator can
choose to arbitrarily change the rules, freeze people's money, offer bad
service, jack up their fees or do a whole host of other things, and the
coordination problems are in the operator's favor, as such systems have
substantial network effects and so very many users would have to agree
at the same time to switch to a better system. In the former case,
client-side validation means that many attempts at mischief that the
miner might want to engage in are by default rejected, and the
coordination problem now works in the users' favor. <br>
<hr />
<p><br> Note that the arguments above do NOT, <em>by themselves</em>,
imply that it is a bad idea for miners to be the principal actors
coordinating and deciding the block size (or in Ethereum's case, the gas
limit). It may well be the case that, <em>in the specific case of the
block size/gas limit</em>, "government by coordinated miners with
aligned incentives" is the optimal approach for deciding this one
particular policy parameter, perhaps because the risk of miners abusing
their power is lower than the risk that any specific chosen hard limit
will prove wildly inappropriate for market conditions a decade after the
limit is set. However, there is nothing unreasonable about saying that
government-by-miners is the best way to decide one policy parameter, and
at the same saying that <em>for other parameters</em> (eg. block reward)
we want to rely on client-side validation to ensure that miners are
constrained. This is the essence of engineering decentralized
instutitions: it is about strategically using coordination problems to
ensure that systems continue to satisfy certain desired properties.</p>
The arguments above also do not imply that it is always optimal to try
to put everything onto a blockchain even for services that are
trust-requiring. There generally are at least some gains to be made by
running more business logic on a blockchain, but they are often much
smaller than the losses to efficiency or privacy. And this ok; the
blockchain is not the best tool for every task. What the arguments above
<em>do</em> imply, though, is that if you are building a
blockchain-based application that contains many centralized components
out of necessity, then you can make substantial further gains in
trust-minimization by giving users a way to access your application
through a regular blockchain client (eg. in the case of Ethereum, this
might be Mist, Parity, Metamask or Status), instead of getting them to
use a web interface that you personally control. <br>
<hr />
<p><br> Theoretically, the benefits of user-side validation are
optimized if literally every user runs an independent "ideal full node"
- a node that accepts all blocks that follow the protocol rules that
everyone agreed to when creating the system, and rejects all blocks that
do not. In practice, however, this involves asking every user to process
every transaction run by everyone in the network, which is clearly
untenable, especially keeping in mind the rapid growth of smartphone
users in the developing world.</p>
<p>There are two ways out here. The first is that we can realize that
while it is <em>optimal</em> from the point of view of the above
arguments that everyone runs a full node, it is certainly not
<em>required</em>. Arguably, any major blockchain running at full
capacity will have already reached the point where it will not make
sense for "the common people" to expend a fifth of their hard drive
space to run a full node, and so the remaining users are hobbyists and
businesses. As long as there is a fairly large number of them, and they
come from diverse backgrounds, the coordination problem of getting these
users to collude will still be very hard.</p>
<p>Second, we can rely on <strong>strong light client
technology</strong>.</p>
<p>There are two levels of "light clients" that are generally possible
in blockchain systems. The first, weaker, kind of light client simply
convinces the user, with some degree of economic assurance, that they
are on the chain that is supported by the majority of the network. This
can be done much more cheaply than verifying the entire chain, as all
clients need to do is in proof of work schemes verify nonces or in proof
stake schemes verify signed certificates that state "either the root
hash of the state is what I say it is, or you can publish this
certificate into the main chain to delete a large amount of my money".
Once the light client verifies a root hash, they can use Merkle trees to
verify any specific piece of data that they might want to verify.</p>
<br>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/coordination-problems-files/ethblockchain_oneblock.png" width="400px" class="padded" /><br>
<small><i>Look, it's a Merkle tree!</i></small>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>The second level is a "nearly fully verifying" light client. This
kind of client doesn't just try to follow the chain that the majority
follows; rather, it also tries to follow only chains that follow all the
rules. This is done by a combination of strategies; the simplest to
explain is that a light client can work together with specialized nodes
(credit to Gavin Wood for coming up with the name "fishermen") whose
purpose is to look for blocks that are invalid and generate "fraud
proofs", short messages that essentially say "Look! This block has a
flaw over here!". Light clients can then verify that specific part of a
block and check if it's actually invalid.</p>
<p>If a block is found to be invalid, it is discarded; if a light client
does not hear any fraud proofs for a given block for a few minutes, then
it assumes that the block is probably legitimate. There's a <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/research/wiki/A-note-on-data-availability-and-erasure-coding">bit
more complexity</a> involved in handling the case where the problem is
not data that is <em>bad</em>, but rather data that is <em>missing</em>,
but in general it is possible to get quite close to catching all
possible ways that miners or validators can violate the rules of the
protocol.</p>
<p>Note that in order for a light client to be able to efficiently
validate a set of application rules, those rules must be executed inside
of consensus - that is, they must be either part of the protocol or part
of a mechanism executing inside the protocol (like a smart contract).
This is a key argument in favor of using the blockchain for both data
storage and business logic execution, as opposed to just data
storage.</p>
<p>These light client techniques are imperfect, in that they do rely on
assumptions about network connectivity and the number of other light
clients and fishermen that are in the network. But it is actually not
crucial for them to work 100% of the time for 100% of validators.
Rather, all that we want is to create a situation where any attempt by a
hostile cartel of miners/validators to push invalid blocks without user
consent will cause a large amount of headaches for lots of people and
ultimately require everyone to update their software if they want to
continue to synchronize with the invalid chain. As long as this is
satisfied, we have achieved the goal of security through coordination
frictions.</p>
