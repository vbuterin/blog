<title> A Note On Charity Through Marginal Price Discrimination </title>

<p><strong>Updated 2018-07-28. See end note.</strong></p>
<p>The following is an interesting idea that I had two years ago that I
personally believe has promise and could be easily implemented in the
context of a blockchain ecosystem, though if desired it could certainly
also be implemented with more traditional technologies (blockchains
would help get the scheme network effects by putting the core logic on a
more neutral platform).</p>
<p>Suppose that you are a restaurant selling sandwiches, and you
ordinarily sell sandwiches for $7.50. Why did you choose to sell them
for $7.50, and not $7.75 or $7.25? It clearly can't be the case that the
cost of production is exactly $7.49999, as in that case you would be
making no profit, and would not be able to cover fixed costs; hence, in
most normal situations you would still be able to make <em>some</em>
profit if you sold at $7.25 or $7.75, though less. Why less at $7.25?
Because the price is lower. Why less at $7.75? Because you get fewer
customers. It just so happens that $7.50 is the point at which the
balance between those two factors is optimal for you.</p>
<center>

<img src="../../../../images/a-note-on-charity-files/pic2.png" style="width: 330px; margin-left: 20px" class="padded" />
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Notice one consequence of this: if you make a <em>slight</em>
distortion to the optimal price, then even compared to the magnitude of
the distortion the losses that you face are minimal. If you raise prices
by 1%, from $7.50 to $7.575, then your profit declines from $6750 to
$6733.12 - a tiny 0.25% reduction. And that's <em>profit</em> - if you
had instead donated 1% of the price of each sandwich, it would have
reduced your profit by 5%. The smaller the distortion the more favorable
the ratio: raising prices by 0.2% only cuts your profits down by
0.01%.</p>
<p>Now, you could argue that stores are not perfectly rational, and not
perfectly informed, and so they may not <em>actually</em> be charging at
optimal prices, all factors considered. However, if you don't know what
direction the deviation is in for any given store, then even still,
<em>in expectation</em>, the scheme works the same way - except instead
of losing $17 it's more like flipping a coin where half the time you
gain $50 and half the time you lose $84. Furthermore, in the more
complex scheme that we will describe later, we'll be adjusting prices in
both directions simultaneously, and so there will not even be any extra
risk - no matter how correct or incorrect the original price was, the
scheme will give you a predictable small net loss.</p>
<p>Also, the above example was one where marginal costs are high, and
customers are picky about prices - in the above model, charging $9 would
have netted you no customers at all. In a situation where <a
href="http://www.thezeromarginalcostsociety.com/">marginal costs are
much lower</a>, and customers are less price-sensitive, the losses from
raising or lowering prices would be even lower.</p>
<p>So what is the point of all this? Well, suppose that our sandwich
shop changes its policy: it sells sandwiches for $7.55 to the general
public, but lowers the prices to $7.35 for people who volunteered in
some charity that maintains some local park (say, this is 25% of the
population). The store's new profit is <span
class="math inline">\(\$6682.5 \cdot 0.25+\$6742.5 \cdot
0.75=\$6727.5\)</span> (that's a $22.5 loss), but the result is that you
are now paying all 4500 of your customers 20 cents each to volunteer at
that charity - an incentive size of $900 (if you just count the
customers who actually do volunteer, $225). So the store loses a bit,
but gets a huge amount of leverage, de-facto contributing at least $225
depending on how you measure it for a cost of only $22.5.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Now, what we can start to do is build up an ecosystem of "stickers",
which are non-transferable digital "tokens" that organizations hand out
to people who they think are contributing to worthy causes. Tokens could
be organized by category (eg. poverty relief, science research,
environmental, local community projects, open source software
development, writing good blogs), and merchants would be free to charge
marginally lower prices to holders of the tokens that represent whatever
causes they personally approve of.</p>
<p>The next stage is to make the scheme recursive - being or working for
a merchant that offers lower prices to holders of green stickers is
itself enough to merit you a green sticker, albeit one that is of lower
potency and gives you a lower discount. This way, if an entire community
approves of a particular cause, it may actually be profit-maximizing to
start offering discounts for the associated sticker, and so economic and
social pressure will maintain a certain level of spending and
participation toward the cause in a stable equilibrium.</p>
<p>As far as implementation goes, this requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>A standard for stickers, including wallets where people can hold
stickers</li>
<li>Payment systems that have support for charging lower prices to
sticker holders included</li>
<li>At least a few sticker-issuing organizations (the lowest overhead is
likely to be issuing stickers for charity donations, and for easily
verifiable online content, eg. open source software and blogs)</li>
</ul>
<p>So this is something that can certainly be bootstrapped within a
small community and user base and then let to grow over time.</p>
<p>Update 2017.03.14: <a
href="https://github.com/vbuterin/research/blob/master/charity_sim.py">here</a>
is an economic model/simulation showing the above implemented as a
Python script.</p>
<p>Update 2018.07.28: after discussions with others (Glen Weyl and
several Reddit commenters), I realized a few extra things about this
mechanism, some encouraging and some worrying:</p>
<ul>
<li>The above mechanism could be used not just by charities, but also by
centralized corporate actors. For example, a large corporation could
offer a bribe of $40 to any store that offers the 20-cent discount to
customers of its products, gaining additional revenue much higher than
$40. So it's empowering but potentially dangerous in the wrong hands... (I
have not researched it but I'm sure this kind of technique is used in
various kinds of loyalty programs already)</li>
<li>The above mechanism has the property that a merchant can "donate"
<span class="math inline">\(\$x\)</span> to charity at a cost of <span
class="math inline">\(\$x^{2}\)</span> (note: <span
class="math inline">\(x^{2}&lt;x\)</span> at the scales we're talking
about here). This gives it a structure that's economically optimal in
certain ways (see <a
href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2003531">quadratic
voting</a>), as a merchant that feels twice as strongly about some
public good will be inclined to offer twice as large a subsidy, whereas
most other social choice mechanisms tend to either undervalue (as in
traditional voting) or overvalue (as in buying policies via lobbying)
stronger vs weaker preferences.</li>
</ul>
