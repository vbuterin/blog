<h3 id="what-is-proof-of-stake">What is Proof of Stake</h3>
<p><strong>Proof of Stake (PoS) is a category of consensus algorithms
for public blockchains that depend on a validator's economic stake in
the network</strong>. In proof of work (PoW) based public blockchains
(e.g. Bitcoin and the current implementation of Ethereum), the algorithm
rewards participants who solve cryptographic puzzles in order to
validate transactions and create new blocks (i.e. mining). In PoS-based
public blockchains (e.g. Ethereum's upcoming Casper implementation), a
set of validators take turns proposing and voting on the next block, and
the weight of each validator's vote depends on the size of its deposit
(i.e. stake). Significant advantages of PoS include <strong>security,
reduced risk of centralization, and energy efficiency</strong>.</p>
<p>In general, a proof of stake algorithm looks as follows. The
blockchain keeps track of a set of validators, and anyone who holds the
blockchain's base cryptocurrency (in Ethereum's case, ether) can become
a validator by sending a special type of transaction that <strong>locks
up their ether into a deposit</strong>. The process of creating and
agreeing to new blocks is then done through a consensus algorithm that
all current validators can participate in.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of consensus algorithms, and many ways to assign
rewards to validators who participate in the consensus algorithm, so
there are many "flavors" of proof of stake. From an algorithmic
perspective, there are two major types: chain-based proof of stake and
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance">BFT</a>-style
proof of stake.</p>
<p>In <strong>chain-based proof of stake</strong>, the algorithm
pseudo-randomly selects a validator during each time slot (e.g. every
period of 10 seconds might be a time slot), and assigns that validator
the right to create a single block, and this block must point to some
previous block (normally the block at the end of the previously longest
chain), and so over time most blocks converge into a single constantly
growing chain.</p>
<p>In <strong>BFT-style proof of stake</strong>, validators are
<strong>randomly</strong> assigned the right to <em>propose</em> blocks,
but <em>agreeing on which block is canonical</em> is done through a
multi-round process where every validator sends a "vote" for some
specific block during each round, and at the end of the process all
(honest and online) validators permanently agree on whether or not any
given block is part of the chain. Note that blocks may still be
<em>chained together</em>; the key difference is that consensus on a
block can come within one block, and does not depend on the length or
size of the chain after it.</p>
<h3
id="what-are-the-benefits-of-proof-of-stake-as-opposed-to-proof-of-work">What
are the benefits of proof of stake as opposed to proof of work?</h3>
<p>See <a
href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/a-proof-of-stake-design-philosophy-506585978d51">A
Proof of Stake Design Philosophy</a> for a more long-form argument.</p>
<p>In short:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No need to consume large quantities of electricity</strong>
in order to secure a blockchain (e.g. it's estimated that both Bitcoin
and Ethereum burn over $1 million worth of electricity and hardware
costs per day as part of their consensus mechanism).</li>
<li>Because of the lack of high electricity consumption, there is
<strong>not as much need to issue as many new coins</strong> in order to
motivate participants to keep participating in the network. It may
theoretically even be possible to have <em>negative</em> net issuance,
where a portion of transaction fees is "burned" and so the supply goes
down over time.</li>
<li>Proof of stake opens the door to a wider array of techniques that
use game-theoretic mechanism design in order to better
<strong>discourage centralized cartels</strong> from forming and, if
they do form, from acting in ways that are harmful to the network
(e.g. like <a
href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ie53/publications/btcProcFC.pdf">selfish
mining</a> in proof of work).</li>
<li><strong>Reduced centralization risks</strong>, as economies of scale
are much less of an issue. $10 million of coins will get you exactly 10
times higher returns than $1 million of coins, without any additional
disproportionate gains because at the higher level you can afford better
mass-production equipment, which is an advantage for Proof-of-Work.</li>
<li>Ability to use economic penalties to <strong>make various forms of
51% attacks vastly more expensive</strong> to carry out than proof of
work - to paraphrase Vlad Zamfir, "it's as though your ASIC farm burned
down if you participated in a 51% attack".</li>
</ul>
<h3
id="how-does-proof-of-stake-fit-into-traditional-byzantine-fault-tolerance-research">How
does proof of stake fit into traditional Byzantine fault tolerance
research?</h3>
<p>There are several fundamental results from Byzantine fault tolerance
research that apply to all consensus algorithms, including traditional
consensus algorithms like PBFT but also any proof of stake algorithm
and, with the appropriate mathematical modeling, proof of work.</p>
<p>The key results include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem"><strong>CAP
theorem</strong></a> - "in the cases that a network partition takes
place, you have to choose either consistency or availability, you cannot
have both". The intuitive argument is simple: if the network splits in
half, and in one half I send a transaction "send my 10 coins to A" and
in the other I send a transaction "send my 10 coins to B", then either
the system is unavailable, as one or both transactions will not be
processed, or it becomes inconsistent, as one half of the network will
see the first transaction completed and the other half will see the
second transaction completed. Note that the CAP theorem has nothing to
do with scalability; it applies to sharded and non-sharded systems
equally. See also
https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQs#but-doesnt-the-cap-theorem-mean-that-fully-secure-distributed-systems-are-impossible-and-so-sharding-is-futile.</li>
<li><a
href="https://www.the-paper-trail.org/post/2008-08-13-a-brief-tour-of-flp-impossibility/"><strong>FLP
impossibility</strong></a> - in an asynchronous setting (i.e. there are
no guaranteed bounds on network latency even between correctly
functioning nodes), it is not possible to create an algorithm which is
guaranteed to reach consensus in any specific finite amount of time if
even a single faulty/dishonest node is present. Note that this does NOT
rule out <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_algorithm">"Las Vegas"
algorithms</a> that have some probability each round of achieving
consensus and thus will achieve consensus within T seconds with
probability exponentially approaching 1 as T grows; this is in fact the
"escape hatch" that many successful consensus algorithms use.</li>
<li><strong>Bounds on fault tolerance</strong> - from <a
href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/jacm88.pdf">the DLS
paper</a> we have: (i) protocols running in a partially synchronous
network model (i.e. there is a bound on network latency but we do not
know ahead of time what it is) can tolerate up to 1/3 arbitrary
(i.e. "Byzantine") faults, (ii) deterministic protocols in an
asynchronous model (i.e. no bounds on network latency) cannot tolerate
faults (although their paper fails to mention that <a
href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-540-77444-0_7">randomized
algorithms can</a> with up to 1/3 fault tolerance), (iii) protocols in a
synchronous model (i.e. network latency is guaranteed to be less than a
known <code>d</code>) can, surprisingly, tolerate up to 100% fault
tolerance, although there are restrictions on what can happen when more
than or equal to 1/2 of nodes are faulty. Note that the "authenticated
Byzantine" model is the one worth considering, not the "Byzantine" one;
the "authenticated" part essentially means that we can use public key
cryptography in our algorithms, which is in modern times very
well-researched and very cheap.</li>
</ul>
<p>Proof of work has been <a
href="https://socrates1024.s3.amazonaws.com/consensus.pdf">rigorously
analyzed by Andrew Miller and others</a> and fits into the picture as an
algorithm reliant on a synchronous network model. We can model the
network as being made up of a near-infinite number of nodes, with each
node representing a very small unit of computing power and having a very
small probability of being able to create a block in a given period. In
this model, the protocol has 50% fault tolerance assuming zero network
latency, ~46% (Ethereum) and ~49.5% (Bitcoin) fault tolerance under
actually observed conditions, but goes down to 33% if network latency is
equal to the block time, and reduces to zero as network latency
approaches infinity.</p>
<p>Proof of stake consensus fits more directly into the Byzantine fault
tolerant consensus mould, as all validators have known identities
(stable Ethereum addresses) and the network keeps track of the total
size of the validator set. There are two general lines of proof of stake
research, one looking at synchronous network models and one looking at
partially asynchronous network models. "Chain-based" proof of stake
algorithms almost always rely on synchronous network models, and their
security can be formally proven within these models similarly to how
security of <a
href="http://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/anonymous-byzantine-consensus.pdf">proof
of work algorithms</a> can be proven. A line of research connecting
traditional Byzantine fault tolerant consensus in partially synchronous
networks to proof of stake also exists, but is more complex to explain;
it will be covered in more detail in later sections.</p>
<p>Proof of work algorithms and chain-based proof of stake algorithms
choose availability over consistency, but BFT-style consensus algorithms
lean more toward consistency; <a
href="https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint">Tendermint</a> chooses
consistency explicitly, and Casper uses a hybrid model that prefers
availability but provides as much consistency as possible and makes both
on-chain applications and clients aware of how strong the consistency
guarantee is at any given time.</p>
<p>Note that Ittay Eyal and Emin Gun Sirer's <a
href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/selfish-mining-a-25-attack-against-the-bitcoin-network-1383578440">selfish
mining</a> discovery, which places 25% and 33% bounds on the incentive
compatibility of Bitcoin mining depending on the network model
(i.e. mining is only incentive compatible if collusions larger than 25%
or 33% are impossible) has NOTHING to do with results from traditional
consensus algorithm research, which does not touch incentive
compatibility.</p>
<h3
id="what-is-the-nothing-at-stake-problem-and-how-can-it-be-fixed">What
is the "nothing at stake" problem and how can it be fixed?</h3>
<p>In many early (all chain-based) proof of stake algorithms, including
Peercoin, there are only rewards for producing blocks, and no penalties.
This has the unfortunate consequence that, in the case that there are
multiple competing chains, it is in a validator's incentive to try to
make blocks on top of every chain at once, just to be sure:</p>
<p><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vbuterin/diagrams/master/possec.png"
class="padded" /></p>
<p>In proof of work, doing so would require splitting one's computing
power in half, and so would not be lucrative:</p>
<p><img
src="https://github.com/vbuterin/diagrams/blob/master/powsec.png?raw=true"
class="padded" /></p>
<p>The result is that if all actors are narrowly economically rational,
then even if there are no attackers, a blockchain may never reach
consensus. If there is an attacker, then the attacker need only
overpower altruistic nodes (who would exclusively stake on the original
chain), and not rational nodes (who would stake on both the original
chain and the attacker's chain), in contrast to proof of work, where the
attacker must overpower both altruists and rational nodes (or at least
credibly threaten to: see <a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/01/28/p-epsilon-attack/">P +
epsilon attacks</a>).</p>
<p>Some argue that stakeholders have an incentive to act correctly and
only stake on the longest chain in order to "preserve the value of their
investment", however this ignores that this incentive suffers from <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">tragedy of
the commons</a> problems: each individual stakeholder might only have a
1% chance of being "pivotal" (i.e. being in a situation where if they
participate in an attack then it succeeds and if they do not participate
it fails), and so the bribe needed to convince them personally to join
an attack would be only 1% of the size of their deposit; hence, the
required combined bribe would be only 0.5-1% of the total sum of all
deposits. Additionally, this argument implies that any
zero-chance-of-failure situation is not a stable equilibrium, as if the
chance of failure is zero then everyone has a 0% chance of being
pivotal.</p>
<p>This can be solved via two strategies. The first, described in broad
terms under the name "Slasher" <a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/01/15/slasher-a-punitive-proof-of-stake-algorithm/">here</a>
and developed further by Iddo Bentov <a
href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.5694.pdf">here</a>, involves penalizing
validators if they simultaneously create blocks on multiple chains, by
means of including proof of misbehavior (i.e. two conflicting signed
block headers) into the blockchain as a later point in time at which
point the malfeasant validator's deposit is deducted appropriately. This
changes the incentive structure thus:</p>
<p><img
src="https://github.com/vbuterin/diagrams/blob/master/slasher1sec.png?raw=true"
class="padded" /></p>
<p>Note that for this algorithm to work, the validator set needs to be
determined well ahead of time. Otherwise, if a validator has 1% of the
stake, then if there are two branches A and B then 0.99% of the time the
validator will be eligible to stake only on A and not on B, 0.99% of the
time the validator will be eligible to stake on B and not on A, and only
0.01% of the time will the validator will be eligible to stake on both.
Hence, the validator can with 99% efficiency probabilistically
double-stake: stake on A if possible, stake on B if possible, and only
if the choice between both is open stake on the longer chain. This can
only be avoided if the validator selection is the same for every block
on both branches, which requires the validators to be selected at a time
before the fork takes place.</p>
<p>This has its own flaws, including requiring nodes to be frequently
online to get a secure view of the blockchain, and opening up
medium-range validator collusion risks (i.e. situations where, for
example, 25 out of 30 consecutive validators get together and agree
ahead of time to implement a 51% attack on the previous 19 blocks), but
if these risks are deemed acceptable then it works well.</p>
<p>The second strategy is to simply punish validators for creating
blocks on the <em>wrong</em> chain. That is, if there are two competing
chains, A and B, then if a validator creates a block on B, they get a
reward of +R on B, but the block header can be included into A (in
Casper this is called a "dunkle") and on A the validator suffers a
penalty of -F (possibly F = R). This changes the economic calculation
thus:</p>
<p><img
src="https://github.com/vbuterin/diagrams/blob/master/slasher2sec.png?raw=true"
class="padded" /></p>
<p>The intuition here is that we can replicate the economics of proof of
work inside of proof of stake. In proof of work, there is also a penalty
for creating a block on the wrong chain, but this penalty is implicit in
the external environment: miners have to spend extra electricity and
obtain or rent extra hardware. Here, we simply make the penalties
explicit. This mechanism has the disadvantage that it imposes slightly
more risk on validators (although the effect should be smoothed out over
time), but has the advantage that it does not require validators to be
known ahead of time.</p>
<h3
id="that-shows-how-chain-based-algorithms-solve-nothing-at-stake.-now-how-do-bft-style-proof-of-stake-algorithms-work">That
shows how chain-based algorithms solve nothing-at-stake. Now how do
BFT-style proof of stake algorithms work?</h3>
<p>BFT-style (partially synchronous) proof of stake algorithms allow
validators to "vote" on blocks by sending one or more types of signed
messages, and specify two kinds of rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finality conditions</strong> - rules that determine when a
given hash can be considered finalized.</li>
<li><strong>Slashing conditions</strong> - rules that determine when a
given validator can be deemed beyond reasonable doubt to have misbehaved
(e.g. voting for multiple conflicting blocks at the same time). If a
validator triggers one of these rules, their entire deposit gets
deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p>To illustrate the different forms that slashing conditions can take,
we will give two examples of slashing conditions (hereinafter, "2/3 of
all validators" is shorthand for "2/3 of all validators weighted by
deposited coins", and likewise for other fractions and percentages). In
these examples, "PREPARE" and "COMMIT" should be understood as simply
referring to two types of messages that validators can send.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If <code>MESSAGES</code> contains messages of the form
<code>["COMMIT", HASH1, view]</code> and
<code>["COMMIT", HASH2, view]</code> for the same <code>view</code> but
differing <code>HASH1</code> and <code>HASH2</code> signed by the same
validator, then that validator is slashed.</li>
<li>If <code>MESSAGES</code> contains a message of the form
<code>["COMMIT", HASH, view1]</code>, then UNLESS either view1 = -1 or
there also exist messages of the form
<code>["PREPARE", HASH, view1, view2]</code> for some specific
<code>view2</code>, where <code>view2 &lt; view1</code>, signed by 2/3
of all validators, then the validator that made the COMMIT is
slashed.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two important desiderata for a suitable set of slashing
conditions to have:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accountable safety</strong> - if conflicting
<code>HASH1</code> and <code>HASH2</code> (i.e. <code>HASH1</code> and
<code>HASH2</code> are different, and neither is a descendant of the
other) are finalized, then at least 1/3 of all validators must have
violated some slashing condition.</li>
<li><strong>Plausible liveness</strong> - unless at least 1/3 of all
validators have violated some slashing condition, there exists a set of
messages that 2/3 of validators can produce that finalize some
value.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we have a set of slashing conditions that satisfies both
properties, then we can incentivize participants to send messages, and
start benefiting from economic finality.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-economic-finality-in-general">What is "economic
finality" in general?</h3>
<p>Economic finality is the idea that once a block is finalized, or more
generally once enough messages of certain types have been signed, then
the only way that at any point in the future the canonical history will
contain a conflicting block is if a large number of people are willing
to burn very large amounts of money. If a node sees that this condition
has been met for a given block, then they have a very economically
strong assurance that that block will always be part of the canonical
history that everyone agrees on.</p>
<p>There are two "flavors" of economic finality:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A block can be economically finalized if a sufficient number of
validators have signed cryptoeconomic claims of the form "I agree to
lose X in all histories where block B is not included". This gives
clients assurance that either (i) B is part of the canonical chain, or
(ii) validators lost a large amount of money in order to trick them into
thinking that this is the case.</li>
<li>A block can be economically finalized if a sufficient number of
validators have signed messages expressing support for block B, and
there is a mathematical proof that <em>if some B' != B is also finalized
under the same definition</em> then validators lose a large amount of
money. If clients see this, and also validate the chain, and validity
plus finality is a sufficient condition for precedence in the canonical
fork choice rule, then they get an assurance that either (i) B is part
of the canonical chain, or (ii) validators lost a large amount of money
in making a conflicting chain that was also finalized.</li>
</ol>
<p>The two approaches to finality inherit from the two solutions to the
nothing at stake problem: finality by penalizing incorrectness, and
finality by penalizing equivocation. The main benefit of the first
approach is that it is more light-client friendly and is simpler to
reason about, and the main benefits of the second approach are that (i)
it's easier to see that honest validators will not be punished, and (ii)
griefing factors are more favorable to honest validators.</p>
<p>Casper follows the second flavor, though it is possible that an
on-chain mechanism will be added where validators can voluntarily opt-in
to signing finality messages of the first flavor, thereby enabling much
more efficient light clients.</p>
<h3 id="so-how-does-this-relate-to-byzantine-fault-tolerance-theory">So
how does this relate to Byzantine fault tolerance theory?</h3>
<p>Traditional byzantine fault tolerance theory posits similar safety
and liveness desiderata, except with some differences. First of all,
traditional byzantine fault tolerance theory simply requires that safety
is achieved if 2/3 of validators are <em>honest</em>. This is a strictly
easier model to work in; traditional fault tolerance tries to prove "if
mechanism M has a safety failure, then at least 1/3 of nodes are
faulty", whereas our model tries to prove "if mechanism M has a safety
failure, then at least 1/3 of nodes are faulty, <em>and you know which
ones, even if you were offline at the time the failure took place</em>".
From a liveness perspective, our model is the easier one, as we do not
demand a proof that the network <em>will</em> come to consensus, we just
demand a proof that it does not get <em>stuck</em>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we can show the additional accountability requirement is
not a particularly difficult one; in fact, with the right "protocol
armor", we can convert <em>any</em> traditional partially synchronous or
asynchronous Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithm into an accountable
algorithm. The proof of this basically boils down to the fact that
faults can be exhaustively categorized into a few classes, and each one
of these classes is either accountable (i.e. if you commit that type of
fault you can get caught, so we can make a slashing condition for it) or
indistinguishable from latency (note that even the fault of sending
messages too early is indistinguishable from latency, as one can model
it by speeding up everyone's clocks and assigning the messages that
<em>weren't</em> sent too early a higher latency).</p>
<h3 id="what-is-weak-subjectivity">What is "weak subjectivity"?</h3>
<p>It is important to note that the mechanism of using deposits to
ensure there is "something at stake" does lead to one change in the
security model. Suppose that deposits are locked for four months, and
can later be withdrawn. Suppose that an attempted 51% attack happens
that reverts 10 days worth of transactions. The blocks created by the
attackers can simply be imported into the main chain as
proof-of-malfeasance (or "dunkles") and the validators can be punished.
However, suppose that such an attack happens after six months. Then,
even though the blocks can certainly be re-imported, by that time the
malfeasant validators will be able to withdraw their deposits on the
main chain, and so they cannot be punished.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, we introduce a "revert limit" - a rule that
nodes must simply refuse to revert further back in time than the deposit
length (i.e. in our example, four months), and we additionally require
nodes to log on at least once every deposit length to have a secure view
of the chain. Note that this rule is different from every other
consensus rule in the protocol, in that it means that nodes may come to
different conclusions depending on when they saw certain messages. The
time that a node saw a given message may be different between different
nodes; hence we consider this rule "subjective" (alternatively, one
well-versed in Byzantine fault tolerance theory may view it as a kind of
synchrony assumption).</p>
<p>However, the "subjectivity" here is very weak: in order for a node to
get on the "wrong" chain, they must receive the original message four
months later than they otherwise would have. This is only possible in
two cases:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>When a node connects to the blockchain for the first time.</li>
<li>If a node has been offline for more than four months.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can solve (1) by making it the user's responsibility to
authenticate the latest state out of band. They can do this by asking
their friends, block explorers, businesses that they interact with, etc.
for a recent block hash in the chain that they see as the canonical one.
In practice, such a block hash may well simply come as part of the
software they use to verify the blockchain; an attacker that can corrupt
the checkpoint in the software can arguably just as easily corrupt the
software itself, and no amount of pure cryptoeconomic verification can
solve that problem. (2) does genuinely add an additional security
requirement for nodes, though note once again that the possibility of
hard forks and security vulnerabilities, and the requirement to stay up
to date to know about them and install any needed software updates,
exists in proof of work too.</p>
<p>Note that all of this is a problem only in the very limited case
where a majority of previous stakeholders from some point in time
collude to attack the network and create an alternate chain; most of the
time we expect there will only be one canonical chain to choose
from.</p>
<h3
id="can-we-try-to-automate-the-social-authentication-to-reduce-the-load-on-users">Can
we try to automate the social authentication to reduce the load on
users?</h3>
<p>One approach is to bake it into natural user workflow: a <a
href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0070.mediawiki">BIP
70</a>-style payment request could include a recent block hash, and the
user's client software would make sure that they are on the same chain
as the vendor before approving a payment (or for that matter, any
on-chain interaction). The other is to use Jeff Coleman's <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phXohYF0xGo">universal hash
time</a>. If UHT is used, then a successful attack chain would need to
be generated secretly <em>at the same time</em> as the legitimate chain
was being built, requiring a majority of validators to secretly collude
for that long.</p>
<h3 id="can-one-economically-penalize-censorship-in-proof-of-stake">Can
one economically penalize censorship in proof of stake?</h3>
<p>Unlike reverts, censorship is much more difficult to prove. The
blockchain itself cannot directly tell the difference between "user A
tried to send transaction X but it was unfairly censored", "user A tried
to send transaction X but it never got in because the transaction fee
was insufficient" and "user A never tried to send transaction X at all".
See also <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/research/wiki/A-note-on-data-availability-and-erasure-coding">a
note on data availability and erasure codes</a>. However, there are a
number of techniques that can be used to mitigate censorship issues.</p>
<p>The first is censorship resistance by halting problem. In the weaker
version of this scheme, the protocol is designed to be Turing-complete
in such a way that a validator cannot even tell whether or not a given
transaction will lead to an undesired action without spending a large
amount of processing power executing the transaction, and thus opening
itself up to denial-of-service attacks. This is what <a
href="http://hackingdistributed.com/2016/07/05/eth-is-more-resilient-to-censorship/">prevented
the DAO soft fork</a>.</p>
<p>In the stronger version of the scheme, transactions can trigger
guaranteed effects at some point in the near to mid-term future. Hence,
a user could send multiple transactions which interact with each other
and with predicted third-party information to lead to some future event,
but the validators cannot possibly tell that this is going to happen
until the transactions are already included (and economically finalized)
and it is far too late to stop them; even if all future transactions are
excluded, the event that validators wish to halt would still take place.
Note that in this scheme, validators could still try to prevent
<strong>all</strong> transactions, or perhaps all transactions that do
not come packaged with some formal proof that they do not lead to
anything undesired, but this would entail forbidding a very wide class
of transactions to the point of essentially breaking the entire system,
which would cause validators to lose value as the price of the
cryptocurrency in which their deposits are denominated would drop.</p>
<p>The second, <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4j7pfj/adam_backs_clever_mechanism_to_prevent_miners/d34t9xa">described
by Adam Back here</a>, is to require transactions to be <a
href="https://www.gwern.net/Self-decrypting%20files">timelock-encrypted</a>.
Hence, validators will include the transactions without knowing the
contents, and only later could the contents automatically be revealed,
by which point once again it would be far too late to un-include the
transactions. If validators were sufficiently malicious, however, they
could simply only agree to include transactions that come with a
cryptographic proof (e.g. ZK-SNARK) of what the decrypted version is;
this would force users to download new client software, but an adversary
could conveniently provide such client software for easy download, and
in a game-theoretic model users would have the incentive to play
along.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best that can be said in a proof-of-stake context is that
users could also install a software update that includes a hard fork
that deletes the malicious validators and this is not that much harder
than installing a software update to make their transactions
"censorship-friendly". Hence, all in all this scheme is also moderately
effective, though it does come at the cost of slowing interaction with
the blockchain down (note that the scheme must be mandatory to be
effective; otherwise malicious validators could much more easily simply
filter encrypted transactions without filtering the quicker unencrypted
transactions).</p>
<p>A third alternative is to include censorship detection in the fork
choice rule. The idea is simple. Nodes watch the network for
transactions, and if they see a transaction that has a sufficiently high
fee for a sufficient amount of time, then they assign a lower "score" to
blockchains that do not include this transaction. If all nodes follow
this strategy, then eventually a minority chain would automatically
coalesce that includes the transactions, and all honest online nodes
would follow it. The main weakness of such a scheme is that offline
nodes would still follow the majority branch, and if the censorship is
temporary and they log back on after the censorship ends then they would
end up on a different branch from online nodes. Hence, this scheme
should be viewed more as a tool to facilitate automated emergency
coordination on a hard fork than something that would play an active
role in day-to-day fork choice.</p>
<h3
id="how-does-validator-selection-work-and-what-is-stake-grinding">How
does validator selection work, and what is stake grinding?</h3>
<p>In any chain-based proof of stake algorithm, there is a need for some
mechanism which randomly selects which validator out of the currently
active validator set can make the next block. For example, if the
currently active validator set consists of Alice with 40 ether, Bob with
30 ether, Charlie with 20 ether and David with 10 ether, then you want
there to be a 40% chance that Alice will be the next block creator, 30%
chance that Bob will be, etc (in practice, you want to randomly select
not just one validator, but rather an infinite sequence of validators,
so that if Alice doesn't show up there is someone who can replace her
after some time, but this doesn't change the fundamental problem). In
non-chain-based algorithms randomness is also often needed for different
reasons.</p>
<p>"Stake grinding" is a class of attack where a validator performs some
computation or takes some other step to try to bias the randomness in
their own favor. For example:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In <a
href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=131901.0">Peercoin</a>, a
validator could "grind" through many combinations of parameters and find
favorable parameters that would increase the probability of their coins
generating a valid block.</li>
<li>In one now-defunct implementation, the randomness for block N+1 was
dependent on the signature of block N. This allowed a validator to
repeatedly produce new signatures until they found one that allowed them
to get the next block, thereby seizing control of the system
forever.</li>
<li>In NXT, the randomness for block N+1 is dependent on the validator
that creates block N. This allows a validator to manipulate the
randomness by simply skipping an opportunity to create a block. This
carries an opportunity cost equal to the block reward, but sometimes the
new random seed would give the validator an above-average number of
blocks over the next few dozen blocks. See <a
href="http://vitalik.ca/files/randomness.html">here</a> and <a
href="https://hackernoon.com/nxt-pos-block-skipping-attack-myth-de88cf4b3363">here</a>
for a more detailed analysis.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li>and (2) are easy to solve; the general approach is to require
validators to deposit their coins well in advance, and not to use
information that can be easily manipulated as source data for the
randomness. There are several main strategies for solving problems like
(3). The first is to use schemes based on <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_sharing">secret sharing</a>
or <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2002/081.pdf">deterministic
threshold signatures</a> and have validators collaboratively generate
the random value. These schemes are robust against all manipulation
unless a majority of validators collude (in some cases though, depending
on the implementation, between 33-50% of validators can interfere in the
operation, leading to the protocol having a 67% liveness
assumption).</li>
</ol>
<p>The second is to use cryptoeconomic schemes where validators commit
to information (i.e. publish <code>sha3(x)</code>) well in advance, and
then must publish <code>x</code> in the block; <code>x</code> is then
added into the randomness pool. There are two theoretical attack vectors
against this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Manipulate <code>x</code> at commitment time. This is impractical
because the randomness result would take many actors' values into
account, and if even one of them is honest then the output will be a
uniform distribution. A uniform distribution XORed together with
arbitrarily many arbitrarily biased distributions still gives a uniform
distribution.</li>
<li>Selectively avoid publishing blocks. However, this attack costs one
block reward of opportunity cost, and because the scheme prevents anyone
from seeing any future validators except for the next, it almost never
provides more than one block reward worth of revenue. The only exception
is the case where, if a validator skips, the next validator in line AND
the first child of that validator will both be the same validator; if
these situations are a grave concern then we can punish skipping further
via an explicit skipping penalty.</li>
</ol>
<p>The third is to use <a
href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.5694.pdf">Iddo Bentov's "majority
beacon"</a>, which generates a random number by taking the bit-majority
of the previous N random numbers generated through some other beacon
(i.e. the first bit of the result is 1 if the majority of the first bits
in the source numbers is 1 and otherwise it's 0, the second bit of the
result is 1 if the majority of the second bits in the source numbers is
1 and otherwise it's 0, etc). This gives a cost-of-exploitation of
<code>~C * sqrt(N)</code> where <code>C</code> is the cost of
exploitation of the underlying beacons. Hence, all in all, many known
solutions to stake grinding exist; the problem is more like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_cryptanalysis">differential
cryptanalysis</a> than <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">the halting
problem</a> - an annoyance that proof of stake designers eventually
understood and now know how to overcome, not a fundamental and
inescapable flaw.</p>
<h3
id="what-would-the-equivalent-of-a-51-attack-against-casper-look-like">What
would the equivalent of a 51% attack against Casper look like?</h3>
<p>There are four basic types of 51% attack:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finality reversion</strong>: validators that already
finalized block A then finalize some competing block A', thereby
breaking the blockchain's finality guarantee.</li>
<li><strong>Invalid chain finalization</strong>: validators finalize an
invalid (or unavailable) block.</li>
<li><strong>Liveness denial</strong>: validators stop finalizing
blocks.</li>
<li><strong>Censorship</strong>: validators block some or all
transactions or blocks from entering the chain.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the first case, users can socially coordinate out-of-band to agree
which finalized block came first, and favor that block. The second case
can be solved with <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/research/wiki/A-note-on-data-availability-and-erasure-coding">fraud
proofs and data availability proofs</a>. The third case can be solved by
a modification to proof of stake algorithms that gradually reduces
("leaks") non-participating nodes' weights in the validator set if they
do not participate in consensus; the <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09437">Casper FFG paper</a> includes a
description of this.</p>
<p>The fourth is most difficult. The fourth can be recovered from via a
"minority soft fork", where a minority of honest validators agree the
majority is censoring them, and stop building on their chain. Instead,
they continue their own chain, and eventually the "leak" mechanism
described above ensures that this honest minority becomes a 2/3
supermajority on the new chain. At that point, the market is expected to
favor the chain controlled by honest nodes over the chain controlled by
dishonest nodes.</p>
<h3
id="that-sounds-like-a-lot-of-reliance-on-out-of-band-social-coordination-is-that-not-dangerous">That
sounds like a lot of reliance on out-of-band social coordination; is
that not dangerous?</h3>
<p>Attacks against Casper are extremely expensive; as we will see below,
attacks against Casper cost as much, if not more, than the cost of
buying enough mining power in a proof of work chain to permanently 51%
attack it over and over again to the point of uselessness. Hence, the
recovery techniques described above will only be used in very extreme
circumstances; in fact, advocates of proof of work also generally
express willingness to use social coordination in similar circumstances
by, for example, <a
href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-developers-changing-proof-work-algorithm/">changing
the proof of work algorithm</a>. Hence, it is not even clear that the
need for social coordination in proof of stake is larger than it is in
proof of work.</p>
<p>In reality, we expect the amount of social coordination required to
be near-zero, as attackers will realize that it is not in their benefit
to burn such large amounts of money to simply take a blockchain offline
for one or two days.</p>
<h3
id="doesnt-mc-mr-mean-that-all-consensus-algorithms-with-a-given-security-level-are-equally-efficient-or-in-other-words-equally-wasteful">Doesn't
MC &lt;= MR mean that all consensus algorithms with a given security
level are equally efficient (or in other words, equally wasteful)?</h3>
<p>This is an argument that many have raised, perhaps best explained by
<a href="http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/pow-cheapest/">Paul Sztorc in
this article</a>. Essentially, if you create a way for people to earn
$100, then people will be willing to spend anywhere up to $99.9
(including the cost of their own labor) in order to get it; marginal
cost approaches marginal revenue. Hence, the theory goes, any algorithm
with a given block reward will be equally "wasteful" in terms of the
quantity of socially unproductive activity that is carried out in order
to try to get the reward.</p>
<p>There are three flaws with this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It's not enough to simply say that marginal cost approaches marginal
revenue; one must also posit a plausible mechanism by which someone can
actually expend that cost. For example, if tomorrow I announce that
every day from then on I will give $100 to a randomly selected one of a
given list of ten people (using my laptop's /dev/urandom as randomness),
then there is simply no way for anyone to send $99 to try to get at that
randomness. Either they are not in the list of ten, in which case they
have no chance no matter what they do, or they are in the list of ten,
in which case they don't have any reasonable way to manipulate my
randomness so they're stuck with getting the expected-value $10 per
day.</li>
<li>MC &lt;= MR does NOT imply total cost approaches total revenue. For
example, suppose that there is an algorithm which pseudorandomly selects
1000 validators out of some very large set (each validator getting a
reward of $1), you have 10% of the stake so on average you get 100, and
at a cost of $1 you can force the randomness to reset (and you can
repeat this an unlimited number of times). Due to the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem">central limit
theorem</a>, the standard deviation of your reward is $10, and based on
<a
href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/89030/expectation-of-the-maximum-of-gaussian-random-variables">other
known results in math</a> the expected maximum of N random samples is
slightly under <code>M + S * sqrt(2 * log(N))</code> where
<code>M</code> is the mean and <code>S</code> is the standard deviation.
Hence the reward for making additional trials (i.e. increasing N) drops
off sharply, e.g. with 0 re-trials your expected reward is $100, with
one re-trial it's $105.5, with two it's $108.5, with three it's $110.3,
with four it's $111.6, with five it's $112.6 and with six it's $113.5.
Hence, after five retrials it stops being worth it. As a result, an
economically motivated attacker with ten percent of stake will
inefficiently spend $5 to get an additional revenue of $13, though the
total revenue is $113. If the exploitable mechanisms only expose small
opportunities, the economic loss will be small; it is decidedly NOT the
case that a single drop of exploitability brings the entire flood of
PoW-level economic waste rushing back in. This point will also be very
relevant in our below discussion on capital lockup costs.</li>
<li>Proof of stake can be secured with much lower total rewards than
proof of work.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="what-about-capital-lockup-costs">What about capital lockup
costs?</h3>
<p>Locking up X ether in a deposit is not free; it entails a sacrifice
of optionality for the ether holder. Right now, if I have 1000 ether, I
can do whatever I want with it; if I lock it up in a deposit, then it's
stuck there for months, and I do not have, for example, the insurance
utility of the money being there to pay for sudden unexpected expenses.
I also lose some freedom to change my token allocations away from ether
within that timeframe; I could simulate selling ether by shorting an
amount equivalent to the deposit on an exchange, but this itself carries
costs including exchange fees and paying interest. Some might argue:
isn't this capital lockup inefficiency really just a highly indirect way
of achieving the exact same level of economic inefficiency as exists in
proof of work? The answer is no, for both reasons (2) and (3) above.</p>
<p>Let us start with (3) first. Consider a model where proof of stake
deposits are infinite-term, ASICs last forever, ASIC technology is fixed
(i.e. no Moore's law) and electricity costs are zero. Let's say the
equilibrium interest rate is 5% per annum. In a proof of work
blockchain, I can take $1000, convert it into a miner, and the miner
will pay me $50 in rewards per year forever. In a proof of stake
blockchain, I would buy $1000 of coins, deposit them (i.e. losing them
forever), and get $50 in rewards per year forever. So far, the situation
looks completely symmetrical (technically, even here, in the proof of
stake case my destruction of coins isn't fully socially destructive as
it makes others' coins worth more, but we can leave that aside for the
moment). The cost of a "Maginot-line" 51% attack (i.e. buying up more
hardware than the rest of the network) increases by $1000 in both
cases.</p>
<p>Now, let's perform the following changes to our model in turn:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Moore's law exists, ASICs depreciate by 50% every 2.772 years
(that's a continuously-compounded 25% annual depreciation; picked to
make the numbers simpler). If I want to retain the same "pay once, get
money forever" behavior, I can do so: I would put $1000 into a fund,
where $167 would go into an ASIC and the remaining $833 would go into
investments at 5% interest; the $41.67 dividends per year would be just
enough to keep renewing the ASIC hardware (assuming technological
development is fully continuous, once again to make the math simpler).
Rewards would go down to $8.33 per year; hence, 83.3% of miners will
drop out until the system comes back into equilibrium with me earning
$50 per year, and so the Maginot-line cost of an attack on PoW given the
same rewards drops by a factor of 6.</li>
<li>Electricity plus maintenance makes up 1/3 of mining costs. We
estimate the 1/3 from recent mining statistics: one of Bitfury's new
data centers consumes <a
href="http://www.coindesk.com/bitfury-details-100-million-georgia-data-center/">0.06
joules per gigahash</a>, or 60 J/TH or 0.000017 kWh/TH, and if we assume
the entire Bitcoin network has similar efficiencies we get 27.9 kWh per
second given <a href="http://bitcoinwatch.com/">1.67 million TH/s total
Bitcoin hashpower</a>. Electricity in China costs <a
href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/477995/global-prices-of-electricity-by-select-country/">$0.11
per kWh</a>, so that's about $3 per second, or $260,000 per day. Bitcoin
block rewards plus fees are $600 per BTC * 13 BTC per block * 144 blocks
per day = $1.12m per day. Thus electricity itself would make up 23% of
costs, and we can back-of-the-envelope estimate maintenance at 10% to
give a clean 1/3 ongoing costs, 2/3 fixed costs split. This means that
out of your $1000 fund, only $111 would go into the ASIC, $56 would go
into paying ongoing costs, and $833 would go into investments; hence the
Maginot-line cost of attack is 9x lower than in our original
setting.</li>
<li>Deposits are temporary, not permanent. Sure, if I voluntarily keep
staking forever, then this changes nothing. However, I regain some of
the optionality that I had before; I could quit within a medium
timeframe (say, 4 months) at any time. This means that I would be
willing to put more than $1000 of ether in for the $50 per year gain;
perhaps in equilibrium it would be something like $3000. Hence, the cost
of the Maginot line attack on PoS <em>increases</em> by a factor of
three, and so on net PoS gives 27x more security than PoW for the same
cost.</li>
</ol>
<p>The above included a large amount of simplified modeling, however it
serves to show how multiple factors stack up heavily in favor of PoS in
such a way that PoS gets <em>more</em> bang for its buck in terms of
security. The meta-argument for why this <a
href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/kpj/multiple_factor_explanations_should_not_appear/">perhaps
suspiciously multifactorial argument</a> leans so heavily in favor of
PoS is simple: in PoW, we are working directly with the laws of physics.
In PoS, we are able to design the protocol in such a way that it has the
precise properties that we want - in short, we can <em>optimize the laws
of physics in our favor</em>. The "hidden trapdoor" that gives us (3) is
the change in the security model, specifically the introduction of weak
subjectivity.</p>
<p>Now, we can talk about the marginal/total distinction. In the case of
capital lockup costs, this is very important. For example, consider a
case where you have $100,000 of ether. You probably intend to hold a
large portion of it for a long time; hence, locking up even $50,000 of
the ether should be nearly free. Locking up $80,000 would be slightly
more inconvenient, but $20,000 of breathing room still gives you a large
space to maneuver. Locking up $90,000 is more problematic, $99,000 is
very problematic, and locking up all $100,000 is absurd, as it means you
would not even have a single bit of ether left to pay basic transaction
fees. Hence, your marginal costs increase quickly. We can show the
difference between this state of affairs and the state of affairs in
proof of work as follows:</p>
<p><img
src="https://blog.ethereum.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/liquidity.png"
class="padded" /></p>
<p>Hence, the <i>total</i> cost of proof of stake is potentially much
lower than the marginal cost of depositing 1 more ETH into the system
multiplied by the amount of ether currently deposited.</p>
<p>Note that this component of the argument unfortunately does not fully
translate into reduction of the "safe level of issuance". It does help
us because it shows that we can get substantial proof of stake
participation even if we keep issuance very low; however, it also means
that a large portion of the gains will simply be borne by validators as
economic surplus.</p>
<h3
id="will-exchanges-in-proof-of-stake-pose-a-similar-centralization-risk-to-pools-in-proof-of-work">Will
exchanges in proof of stake pose a similar centralization risk to pools
in proof of work?</h3>
<p>From a centralization perspective, in both <a
href="https://blockchain.info/pools">Bitcoin</a> and <a
href="https://etherscan.io/stat/miner?range=7&amp;blocktype=blocks">Ethereum</a>
it's the case that roughly three pools are needed to coordinate on a 51%
attack (4 in Bitcoin, 3 in Ethereum at the time of this writing). In
PoS, if we assume 30% participation including all exchanges, then <a
href="https://etherscan.io/accounts">three exchanges</a> would be enough
to make a 51% attack; if participation goes up to 40% then the required
number goes up to eight. However, exchanges will not be able to
participate with all of their ether; the reason is that they need to
accomodate withdrawals.</p>
<p>Additionally, pooling in PoS is discouraged because it has a much
higher trust requirement - a proof of stake pool can pretend to be
hacked, destroy its participants' deposits and claim a reward for it. On
the other hand, the ability to earn interest on one's coins without
oneself running a node, even if trust is required, is something that
many may find attractive; all in all, the centralization balance is an
empirical question for which the answer is unclear until the system is
actually running for a substantial period of time. With sharding, we
expect pooling incentives to reduce further, as (i) there is even less
concern about variance, and (ii) in a sharded model, transaction
verification load is proportional to the amount of capital that one puts
in, and so there are no direct infrastructure savings from pooling.</p>
<p>A final point is that centralization is less harmful in proof of
stake than in proof of work, as there are much cheaper ways to recover
from successful 51% attacks; one does not need to switch to a new mining
algorithm.</p>
<h3 id="are-there-economic-ways-to-discourage-centralization">Are there
economic ways to discourage centralization?</h3>
<p>One strategy suggested by Vlad Zamfir is to only partially destroy
deposits of validators that get slashed, setting the percentage
destroyed to be proportional to the percentage of other validators that
have been slashed recently. This ensures that validators lose all of
their deposits in the event of an actual attack, but only a small part
of their deposits in the event of a one-off mistake. This makes
lower-security staking strategies possible, and also specifically
incentivizes validators to have their errors be as uncorrelated (or
ideally, anti-correlated) with other validators as possible; this
involves not being in the largest pool, putting one's node on the
largest virtual private server provider and even using secondary
software implementations, all of which increase decentralization.</p>
<h3 id="can-proof-of-stake-be-used-in-privateconsortium-chains">Can
proof of stake be used in private/consortium chains?</h3>
<p>Generally, yes; any proof of stake algorithm can be used as a
consensus algorithm in private/consortium chain settings. The only
change is that the way the validator set is selected would be different:
it would start off as a set of trusted users that everyone agrees on,
and then it would be up to the validator set to vote on adding in new
validators.</p>
<h3 id="can-multi-currency-proof-of-stake-work">Can multi-currency proof
of stake work?</h3>
<p>There has been a lot of interest in proof of stake protocols where
users can stake any currency, or one of multiple currencies. However,
these designs unfortunately introduce economic challenges that likely
make them much more trouble than any benefit that could be received from
them. The key problems include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Price oracle dependence</strong>: if people are staking in
multiple cryptocurrencies, there needs to be a way to compare deposits
in one versus the other, so as to fairly allocate proposal rights,
determine whether or not a 2/3 threshold was passed, etc. This requires
some form of price oracle. This can be done in a decentralized way (eg.
see Uniswap), but it introduces another component that could be
manipulated and attacked by validators.</li>
<li><strong>Pathological cryptocurrencies</strong>: one can always
create a cryptocurrency that is pathologically constructed to nullify
the impact of penalties. For example, one can imagine a fiat-backed
token where coins that are seized by the protocol as penalties are
tracked and not honored by the issuer, and the penalized actor's
original balance is honored instead. This logic could even be
implemented in a smart contract, and it's impossible to determine with
certainty whether or not a given currency has such a mechanism
built-in.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced incentive alignment</strong>: if currencies other
than the protocol's base token can be used to stake, this reduces the
stakers' interest in seeing the protocol continue to operate and
succeed.</li>
</ul>
