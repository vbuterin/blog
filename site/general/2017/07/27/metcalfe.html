<p>Looks like it's blockchain split season <a
href="http://bitcoincash.org/">again</a>. For background of various
people discussing the topic, and whether such splits are good or
bad:</p>
<ul>
<li>Power laws and network effects (arguing the BTC/BCC split may
destroy value due to network effect loss): <a

</ul>
Given that ecosystem splits are not going away, and we may well see more
of them in the crypto industry over the next decade, it seems useful to
inform the discussion with some simple economic modeling. With that in
mind, let's get right to it. <br>
<hr />
<p><br></p>
<p>Suppose that there exist two projects A and B, and a set of users of
total size <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, where A has <span
class="math inline">\(N_a\)</span> users and B has <span
class="math inline">\(N_b\)</span> users. Both projects benefit from
network effects, so they have a utility that increases with the number
of users. However, users also have their own differing taste
preferences, and this may lead them to choose the smaller platform over
the bigger platform if it suits them better.</p>
<p>We can model each individual's private utility in one of four
ways:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 49%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>1. <span class="math inline">\(U(A) = p + N_a\)</span></td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(U(B) = q + N_b\)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>2. <span class="math inline">\(U(A) = p \cdot N_a\)</span></td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(U(B) = q \cdot N_b\)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>3. <span class="math inline">\(U(A) = p + \ln{N_a}\)</span></td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(U(B) = q + \ln{N_b}\)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>4. <span class="math inline">\(U(A) = p \cdot \ln{N_a}\)</span>
      </td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(U(B) = q \cdot \ln{N_b}\)</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span> are private per-user parameters that
you can think of as corresponding to users' distinct preferences. The
difference between the first two approaches and the last two reflects
differences between interpretations of Metcalfe's law, or more broadly
the idea that the per-user value of a system grows with the number of
users. The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law">original
formulation</a> suggested a per-user value of <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> (that is, a total network value of
<span class="math inline">\(N^{2}\)</span>), but other analysis (see <a
href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/metcalfes-law-is-wrong">here</a>)
suggests that above very small scales <span
class="math inline">\(N\log{N}\)</span> usually dominates; there is a
controversy over which model is correct. The difference between the
first and second (and between the third and fourth) is the extent to
which utility from a system's intrinsic quality and utility from network
effects are complementary - that is, are the two things good in
completely separate ways that do not interact with each other, like
social media and coconuts, or are network effects an important part of
letting the intrinsic quality of a system shine?</p>
<p>We can now analyze each case in turn by looking at a situation where
<span class="math inline">\(N_a\)</span> users choose A and <span
class="math inline">\(N_b\)</span> users choose B, and analyze each
individual's decision to choose one or the other from the perspective of
economic externalities - that is, does a user's choice to switch from A
to B have a positive net effect on others' utility or a negative one? If
switching has a positive externality, then it is virtuous and should be
socially nudged or encouraged, and if it has a negative externality then
it should be discouraged. We model an "ecosystem split" as a game where
to start off <span class="math inline">\(N_a = N\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(N_b = 0\)</span> and users are deciding for
themselves whether or not to join the split, that is, to move from A to
B, possibly causing <span class="math inline">\(N_a\)</span> to fall and
<span class="math inline">\(N_b\)</span> to rise.</p>
<p>Switching (or not switching) from A to B has externalties because A
and B both have network effects; switching from A to B has the negative
externality of reducing A's network effect, and so hurting all remaining
A users, but it also has the positive externality of increasing B's
network effect, and so benefiting all B users.</p>
<h4 id="case-1">Case 1</h4>
<p>Switching from A to B gives <span class="math inline">\(N_a\)</span>
users a negative externality of one, so a total loss of <span
class="math inline">\(N_a\)</span>, and it gives <span
class="math inline">\(N_b\)</span> users a positive externality of one,
so a total gain of <span class="math inline">\(N_b\)</span>. Hence, the
total externality is of size <span class="math inline">\(N_b -
N_a\)</span>; that is, switching from the smaller to the larger platform
has positive externalities, and switching from the larger platform to
the smaller platform has negative externalities.</p>
<h4 id="case-2">Case 2</h4>
<p>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(P_a\)</span> is the sum of <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> values of <span
class="math inline">\(N_a\)</span> users, and <span
class="math inline">\(Q_b\)</span> is the sum of <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span> values of <span
class="math inline">\(N_b\)</span> users. The total negative externality
is <span class="math inline">\(P_a\)</span> and the total positive
externality is <span class="math inline">\(Q_b\)</span>. Hence,
switching from the smaller platform to the larger has positive social
externalities if the two platforms have equal intrinsic quality to their
users (ie. users of A intrinsically enjoy A as much as users of B
intrinsically enjoy B, so <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> values are evenly distributed),
but if it is the case that A is bigger but B is better, then there are
positive externalities in switching to B.</p>
<p>Furthermore, notice that if a user is making a switch from a larger A
to a smaller B, then this itself is revealed-preference evidence that,
for that user, and for all existing users of B, <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{q}{p} &gt; \frac{N_a}{N_b}\)</span>.
However, if the split stays as a split, and does not proceed to become a
full-scale migration, then that means that users of A hold different
views, though this could be for two reasons: (i) they intrinsically
dislike A but not by enough to justify the switch, (ii) they
intrinsically like A more than B. This could arise because (a) A users
have a higher opinion of A than B users, or (b) A users have a lower
opinion of B than B users. In general, we see that moving from a system
that makes its average user less happy to a system that makes its
average user more happy has positive externalities, and in other
situations it's difficult to say.</p>
<h4 id="case-3">Case 3</h4>
<p>The derivative of <span class="math inline">\(\ln{x}\)</span> is
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{x}\)</span>. Hence, switching from
A to B gives <span class="math inline">\(N_a\)</span> users a negative
externality of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{N_a}\)</span>, and
it gives <span class="math inline">\(N_b\)</span> users a positive
externality of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{N_b}\)</span>.
Hence, the negative and positive externalities are both of total size
one, and thus cancel out. Hence, switching from one platform to the
other imposes no social externalities, and it is socially optimal if all
users switch from A to B if and only if they think that it is a good
idea for them personally to do so.</p>
<h4 id="case-4">Case 4</h4>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(P_a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Q_b\)</span> are before. The negative externality
is of total size <span class="math inline">\(\frac{P_a}{N_a}\)</span>
and the positive externality is of total size <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{Q_b}{N_b}\)</span>. Hence, if the two
systems have equal intrinsic quality, the externality is of size zero,
but if one system has higher intrinsic quality, then it is virtuous to
switch to it. Note that as in case 2, if users <em>are</em> switching
from a larger system to a smaller system, then that means that they find
the smaller system to have higher intrinsic quality, although, also as
in case 2, if the split remains a split and does not become a full-scale
migration, then that means other users see the intrinsic quality of the
larger system as higher, or at least not lower by enough to be worth the
network effects.</p>
<p>The existence of users switching to B suggests that for them, <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{q}{p} \geq
\frac{log{N_a}}{log{N_b}}\)</span>, so for the <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{Q_B}{N_b} &gt; \frac{P_a}{N_a}\)</span>
condition to not hold (ie. for a move from a larger system to a smaller
system not to have positive externalities) it would need to be the case
that users of A have similarly high values of <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> - an approximate heuristic is, the
users of A would need to love A so much that if <em>they</em> were the
ones in the minority that would be willing to split off and move to (or
stay with) the smaller system. In general, it thus seems that moves from
larger systems to smaller systems that actually do happen will have
positive externalities, but it is far from ironclad that this is the
case.</p>
<br>
<hr />
<p><br></p>
<p>Hence, if the first model is true, then to maximize social welfare we
should be trying to nudge people to switch to (or stay with) larger
systems over smaller systems, and splits should be discouraged. If the
fourth model is true, then we should be at least slightly trying to
nudge people to switch to smaller systems over larger systems, and
splits should be slightly encouraged. If the third model is true, then
people will choose the socially optimal thing all by themselves, and if
the second model is true, it's a toss-up.</p>
<p>It is my personal view that the truth lies somewhere between the
third and fourth models, and the first and second greatly overstate
network effects above small scales. The first and second model (the
<span class="math inline">\(N^{2}\)</span> form of Metcalfe's law)
essentially state that a system growing from 990 million to 1 billion
users gives the same increase in per-user utility as growing from
100,000 to 10.1 million users, which seems very unrealistic, whereas the
<span class="math inline">\(N\log{N}\)</span> model (growing from 100
million to 1 billion users gives the same increase in per-user utility
as growing from 100,000 to 10 million users) intuitively seems much more
correct.</p>
<p>And the third model says: if you see people splitting off from a
larger system to create a smaller system because they want something
that more closely matches their personal values, then the fact that
these people have already shown that they value this switch enough to
give up the comforts of the original system's network effects is by
itself enough evidence to show that the split is socially beneficial.
Hence, unless I can be convinced that the first model is true, or that
the second model is true and the specific distributions of <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span> values make splits make negative
negative externalities, I maintain my existing view that those splits
that actually do happen (though likely not <em>hypothetical</em> splits
that end up not happening due to lack of interest) are in the long term
socially beneficial, value-generating events.</p>
