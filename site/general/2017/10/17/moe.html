<title> On Medium-of-Exchange Token Valuations </title>

<p>One kind of token model that has become popular among many recent
token sale projects is the "network medium of exchange token". The
general pitch for this kind of token goes as follows. We, the
developers, build a network, and this network allows you to do new cool
stuff. This network is a sharing-economy-style system: it consists
purely of a set of sellers, that provide resources within some protocol,
and buyers that purchase the services, where both buyers and sellers
come from the community. But the purchase and sale of things within this
network <em>must</em> be done with the new token that we're selling, and
this is why the token will have value.</p>
<p>If it were the developers themselves that were acting as the seller,
then this would be a very reasonable and normal arrangement, very
similar in nature to a Kickstarter-style product sale. The token
actually would, in a meaningful economic sense, be backed by the
services that are provided by the developers.</p>
<p>We can see this in more detail by describing what is going on in a
simple economic model. Suppose that <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> people value a product that a developer
wants to release at <span class="math inline">\(\$x\)</span>, and
believe the developer will give them the product. The developer does a
sale, and raises <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> units for <span
class="math inline">\(\$w &lt; x\)</span> each, thus raising a total
revenue of <span class="math inline">\(\$Nw\)</span>. The developer
builds the product, and gives it to each of the buyers. At the end of
the day, the buyers are happy, and the developer is happy. Nobody feels
like they made an avoidable mistake in participating, and everyone's
expectations have been met. This kind of economic model is clearly
stable.</p>
<p>Now, let's look at the story with a "medium of exchange" token. <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> people value a product that will exist
in a decentralized network at <span class="math inline">\(\$x\)</span>;
the product will be sold at a price of <span class="math inline">\(\$w
&lt; x\)</span>. They each buy <span class="math inline">\(\$w\)</span>
of tokens in the sale. The developer builds the network. Some sellers
come in, and offer the product inside the network for <span
class="math inline">\(\$w\)</span>. The buyers use their tokens to
purchase this product, spending <span class="math inline">\(\$w\)</span>
of tokens and getting <span class="math inline">\(\$x\)</span> of value.
The sellers spend <span class="math inline">\(\$v &lt; w\)</span> of
resources and effort producing this product, and they now have <span
class="math inline">\(\$w\)</span> worth of tokens.</p>
<p>Notice that here, the cycle is not complete, and in fact it never
will be; there needs to be an ongoing stream of buyers and sellers for
the token to continue having its value. The stream does not strictly
speaking <em>have to be</em> endless; if in every round there is a
chance of at least <span class="math inline">\(\frac{v}{w}\)</span> that
there will be a next round, then the model still works, as even though
<em>someone</em> will eventually be cheated, the risk of any individual
participant becoming that person is lower than the benefit that they get
from participating. It's also totally possible that the token would
depreciate in each round, with its value multiplying by some factor
<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{v}{w} &lt; f &lt; 1\)</span>, until it
eventually reaches a price of zero, and it would still be on net in
everyone's interest to participate. Hence, the model is theoretically
feasible, but you can see how this model is more complex and more
tenuous than the simple "developers as seller" model.</p>

<hr />
<p><br></p>
<p>Traditional macroeconomics has a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_exchange">simple
equation</a> to try to value a medium of exchange:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(MV = PT\)</span></p>
<p>Here:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is the total money supply;
that is, the total number of coins</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is the "velocity of money";
that is, the number of times that an average coin changes hands every
day</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is the "price level". This is
the price of goods and services <em>in terms of</em> the token; so it is
actually the <em>inverse</em> of the currency's price</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is the transaction volume:
the economic value of transactions per day</li>
</ul>
<p>The proof for this is a trivial equality: if there are <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> coins, and each changes hands <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> times per day, then this is <span
class="math inline">\(M \cdot N\)</span> coins' worth of economic value
transacted per day. If this represents <span
class="math inline">\(\$T\)</span> worth of economic value, then the
price of each coin is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{T}{M \cdot
N}\)</span>, so the "price level" is the inverse of this, <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{M \cdot N}{T}\)</span>.</p>
<p>For easier analysis, we can recast two variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>We refer to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{V}\)</span> with
<span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>, the time that a user holds a
coin before using it to make a transaction</li>
<li>We refer to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{P}\)</span> with
<span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, the price of the currency (think
<span class="math inline">\(C = cost\)</span>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, we have:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\frac{M}{H} = \frac{T}{C}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(MC = TH\)</span></p>
<p>The left term is quite simply the market cap. The right term is the
economic value transacted per day, multiplied by the amount of time that
a user holds a coin before using it to transact.</p>
<p>This is a steady-state model, assuming that the same quantity of
users will also be there. In reality, however, the quantity of users may
change, and so the price may change. The time that users hold a coin may
change, and this may cause the price to change as well.</p>
<p>Let us now look once again at the economic effect on the users.
<em>What do users lose</em> by using an application with a built-in
appcoin rather than plain old ether (or bitcoin, or USD)? The simplest
way to express this is as follows: the "implicit cost" imposed by such a
system on users <em>the cost to the user of holding those coins for that
period of time, instead of holding that value in the currency that they
would otherwise have preferred to hold</em>.</p>
<p>There are many factors involved in this cost: cognitive costs,
exchange costs and spreads, transaction fees, and many smaller items.
One particular significant factor of this implicit cost is expected
return. If a user expects the appcoin to only grow in value by 1% per
year, while their other available alternatives grow 3% per year, and
they hold $20 of the currency for five days, then that is an expected
loss of roughly <span class="math inline">\(\$20 \cdot 2% \cdot 5 / 365
= \$0.0054\)</span>.</p>
<p>One immediate conclusion from this particular insight is that
<strong>appcoins are very much a multi-equilibrium game</strong>. If the
appcoin grows at 2% per year, then the fee drops to $0.0027, and this
essentially makes the "de-facto fee" of the application (or at least a
large component of it) 2x cheaper, attracting more users and growing its
value more. If the appcoin starts falling at 10% per year, however, then
the "de-facto fee" grows to $0.035, driving many users away and
accelerating its growth.</p>
<p>This leads to increased opportunities for market manipulation, as a
manipulator would not just be wasting their money fighting against a
single equilibrium, but may in fact successfully nudge a given currency
from one equilibrium into another, and profit from successfully
"predicting" (ie. causing) this shift. It also means there is a large
amount of path dependency, and established brands matter a lot; witness
the epic battles over which fork of the bitcoin blockchain can be called
Bitcoin for one particular high-profile example.</p>
<p>Another, and perhaps even more important, conclusion is that the
market cap of an appcoin <strong>depends crucially on the holding time
<span class="math inline">\(H\)</span></strong>. If someone creates a
very efficient exchange, which allows users to purchase an appcoin in
real time and then immediately use it in the application, then allowing
sellers to immediately cash out, then the market cap would drop
precipitously. If a currency is stable or prospects are looking
optimistic, then this may not matter because users actually see no
disadvantage from holding the token instead of holding something else
(ie. zero "de-facto fee"), but if prospects start to turn sour then such
a well-functioning exchange can acelerate its demise.</p>
<p>You might think that exchanges are inherently inefficient, requiring
users to create an account, login, deposit coins, wait for 36
confirmations, trade and logout, but in fact hyper-efficient exchanges
are around the corner. <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/55m04x/lets_run_onchain_decentralized_exchanges_the_way/">Here</a>
is a thread discussing designs for fully autonomous synchronous on-chain
transactions, which can convert token A into token B, and possibly even
then use token B to do something, <em>within a single transaction</em>.
Many other platforms are being developed as well.</p>
<p>What this all serves to show is that relying purely on the
medium-of-exchange argument to support a token value, while attractive
because of its seeming ability to print money out of thin air, is
ultimately quite brittle. Protocol tokens using this model may well be
sustained for some time due to irrationality and temporary equilibria
where the implicit cost of holding the token is zero, but it is a kind
of model which always has an unavoidable risk of collapsing at any
time.</p>
<br>
<hr />
<p><br></p>
<p>So what is the alternative? One simple alternative is the etherdelta
approach, where an application simply collects fees in the interface.
One common criticism is: but can't someone fork the interface to take
out the fees? A counter-retort is: someone can also fork the interface
to replace your protocol token with ETH, BTC, DOGE or whatever else
users would prefer to use. One can make a more sophisticated argument
that this is hard because the "pirate" version would have to compete
with the "official" version for network effect, but one can just as
easily create an official fee-paying client that refuses to interact
with non-fee-paying clients as well; this kind of network effect-based
enforcement is similar to how value-added-taxes are typically enforced
in Europe and other places. Official-client buyers would not interact
with non-official-client sellers, and official-client sellers would not
interact with non-official-client buyers, so a large group of users
would need to switch to the "pirate" client at the same time to
successfully dodge fees. This is not perfectly robust, but it is
certainly as good as the approach of creating a new protocol token.</p>
<p>If developers want to front-load revenue to fund initial development,
then they can sell a token, with the property that all fees paid are
used to buy back some of the token and burn it; this would make the
token backed by the future expected value of upcoming fees spent inside
the system. One can transform this design into a more direct utility
token by requiring users to use the utility token to pay fees, and
having the interface use an exchange to automatically purchase tokens if
the user does not have tokens already.</p>
<p>The important thing is that for the token to have a stable value, it
is highly beneficial for the token supply to have <strong>sinks</strong>
- places where tokens actually disappear and so the total token quantity
decreases over time. This way, there is a more transparent and explicit
fee paid by users, instead of the highly variable and difficult to
calculate "de-facto fee", and there is also a more transparent and
explicit way to figure out what the value of protocol tokens should
be.</p>
