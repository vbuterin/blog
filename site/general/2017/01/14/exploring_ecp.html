<p><strong>Trigger warning: math.</strong></p>
<p>One of the key cryptographic primitives behind various constructions,
including deterministic threshold signatures, zk-SNARKs and other
simpler forms of zero-knowledge proofs is the elliptic curve pairing.
Elliptic curve pairings (or "bilinear maps") are a recent addition to a
30-year-long history of using elliptic curves for cryptographic
applications including encryption and digital signatures; pairings
introduce a form of "encrypted multiplication", greatly expanding what
elliptic curve-based protocols can do. The purpose of this article will
be to go into elliptic curve pairings in detail, and explain a general
outline of how they work.</p>
<p>You're not expected to understand everything here the first time you
read it, or even the tenth time; this stuff is genuinely hard. But
hopefully this article will give you at least a bit of an idea as to
what is going on under the hood.</p>
<p>Elliptic curves themselves are very much a nontrivial topic to
understand, and this article will generally assume that you know how
they work; if you do not, I recommend this article here as a primer: <a
href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/">https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/</a>.
As a quick summary, elliptic curve cryptography involves mathematical
objects called "points" (these are literal two-dimensional points with
<span class="math inline">\((x, y)\)</span> coordinates), with special
formulas for adding and subtracting them (ie. for calculating the
coordinates of <span class="math inline">\(R = P + Q\)</span>), and you
can also multiply a point by an integer (ie. <span
class="math inline">\(P \cdot n = P + P + ... + P\)</span>, though there's
a much faster way to compute it if <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is big).</p>
<br>

<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*2PxXNwMceh1XC_waAP9NiA.jpeg" /><br><br>
<small><i>Here's how point addition looks like graphically.</i></small>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>There exists a special point called the "point at infinity" (<span
class="math inline">\(O\)</span>), the equivalent of zero in point
arithmetic; it's always the case that <span class="math inline">\(P + O
= P\)</span>. Also, a curve has an "<strong>order</strong>"; there
exists a number <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(P \cdot n = O\)</span> for any <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> (and of course, <span
class="math inline">\(P \cdot (n+1) = P, P \cdot (7 \cdot n + 5) = P
\cdot 5\)</span>, and so on). There is also some commonly agreed upon
"generator point" <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, which is
understood to in some sense represent the number <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Theoretically, any point on a curve
(except <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>) can be <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>; all that matters is that <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is standardized.</p>
<p>Pairings go a step further in that they allow you to check certain
kinds of more complicated equations on elliptic curve points — for
example, if <span class="math inline">\(P = G \cdot p, Q = G \cdot
q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R = G \cdot r\)</span>, you
can check whether or not <span class="math inline">\(p \cdot q =
r\)</span>, having just <span class="math inline">\(P, Q\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> as inputs. This might seem like
the fundamental security guarantees of elliptic curves are being broken,
as information about <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is leaking
from just knowing P, but it turns out that the leakage is highly
contained — specifically, the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decisional_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_assumption">decisional
Diffie Hellman problem</a> is easy, but the computational Diffie Hellman
problem (knowing <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> in the above example,
<em>computing</em> <span class="math inline">\(R = G \cdot p \cdot
q\)</span>) and the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm">discrete
logarithm problem</a> (recovering <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
from <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>) remain computationally
infeasible (at least, if they were before).</p>
<p>A third way to look at what pairings do, and one that is perhaps most
illuminating for most of the use cases that we are about, is that if you
view elliptic curve points as one-way encrypted numbers (that is, <span
class="math inline">\(encrypt(p) = p \cdot G = P\)</span>), then whereas
traditional elliptic curve math lets you check <em>linear</em>
constraints on the numbers (eg. if <span class="math inline">\(P = G
\cdot p, Q = G \cdot q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R = G
\cdot r\)</span>, checking <span class="math inline">\(5 \cdot P + 7
\cdot Q = 11 \cdot R\)</span> is <em>really</em> checking that <span
class="math inline">\(5 \cdot p + 7 \cdot q = 11 \cdot r\)</span>),
pairings let you check <em>quadratic</em> constraints (eg. checking
<span class="math inline">\(e(P, Q) \cdot e(G, G \cdot 5) = 1\)</span>
is <em>really</em> checking that <span class="math inline">\(p \cdot q +
5 = 0\)</span>). And going up to quadratic is enough to let us work with
deterministic threshold signatures, quadratic arithmetic programs and
all that other good stuff.</p>
<p>Now, what is this funny <span class="math inline">\(e(P, Q)\)</span>
operator that we introduced above? This is the pairing. Mathematicians
also sometimes call it a <em>bilinear map</em>; the word "bilinear" here
basically means that it satisfies the constraints:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(e(P, Q + R) = e(P, Q) \cdot e(P,
R)\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(e(P + S, Q) = e(P, Q) \cdot e(S,
Q)\)</span></p>
<p>Note that <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\cdot\)</span> can be arbitrary operators; when
you're creating fancy new kinds of mathematical objects, abstract
algebra doesn't care how <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\cdot\)</span> are <em>defined</em>, as long
as they are consistent in the usual ways, eg. <span
class="math inline">\(a + b = b + a, (a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b
\cdot c)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((a \cdot c) + (b \cdot
c) = (a + b) \cdot c\)</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> were simple <em>numbers</em>,
then making a simple pairing is easy: we can do <span
class="math inline">\(e(x, y) = 2^{xy}\)</span>. Then, we can see:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(e(3, 4+ 5) = 2^{3 \cdot 9} =
2^{27}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(e(3, 4) \cdot e(3, 5) = 2^{3 \cdot 4}
\cdot 2^{3 \cdot 5} = 2^{12} \cdot 2^{15} = 2^{27}\)</span></p>
<p>It's bilinear!</p>
<p>However, such simple pairings are not suitable for cryptography
because the objects that they work on are simple integers and are too
easy to analyze; integers make it easy to divide, compute logarithms,
and make various other computations; simple integers have no concept of
a "public key" or a "one-way function". Additionally, with the pairing
described above you can go backwards - knowing <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, and knowing <span
class="math inline">\(e(x, y)\)</span>, you can simply compute a
division and a logarithm to determine <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. We want mathematical objects that are
as close as possible to "black boxes", where you can add, subtract,
multiply and divide, <em>but do nothing else</em>. This is where
elliptic curves and elliptic curve pairings come in.</p>
<p>It turns out that it is possible to make a bilinear map over elliptic
curve points — that is, come up with a function <span
class="math inline">\(e(P, Q)\)</span> where the inputs <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> are elliptic curve points, and where
the output is what's called an <span
class="math inline">\((F_p)^{12}\)</span> element (at least in the
specific case we will cover here; the specifics differ depending on the
details of the curve, more on this later), but the math behind doing so
is quite complex.</p>
<p>First, let's cover prime fields and extension fields. The pretty
elliptic curve in the picture earlier in this post only looks that way
if you assume that the curve equation is defined using regular real
numbers. However, if we actually use regular real numbers in
cryptography, then you can use logarithms to "go backwards", and
everything breaks; additionally, the amount of space needed to actually
store and represent the numbers may grow arbitrarily. Hence, we instead
use numbers in a <strong>prime field</strong>.</p>
<p>A prime field consists of the set of numbers <span
class="math inline">\(0, 1, 2... p-1\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is prime, and the various operations
are defined as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(a + b: (a + b)\)</span> % <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(a \cdot b: (a \cdot b)\)</span> % <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(a - b: (a - b)\)</span> % <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(a / b: (a \cdot b^{p-2})\)</span> % <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span></p>
<p>Basically, all math is done modulo <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> (see <a
href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/what-is-modular-arithmetic">here</a>
for an introduction to modular math). Division is a special case;
normally, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{3}{2}\)</span> is not an
integer, and here we want to deal only with integers, so we instead try
to find the number <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> such that
<span class="math inline">\(x \cdot 2 = 3\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(\cdot\)</span> of course refers to modular
multiplication as defined above. Thanks to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat&#39;s_little_theorem">Fermat's
little theorem</a>, the exponentiation trick shown above does the job,
but there is also a faster way to do it, using the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm">Extended
Euclidean Algorithm</a>. Suppose <span class="math inline">\(p =
7\)</span>; here are a few examples:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(2 + 3 = 5\)</span> % <span
class="math inline">\(7 = 5\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(4 + 6 = 10\)</span> % <span
class="math inline">\(7 = 3\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(2 - 5 = -3\)</span> % <span
class="math inline">\(7 = 4\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(6 \cdot 3 = 18\)</span> % <span
class="math inline">\(7 = 4\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(3 / 2 = (3 \cdot 2^5)\)</span> % <span
class="math inline">\(7 = 5\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(5 \cdot 2 = 10\)</span> % <span
class="math inline">\(7 = 3\)</span></p>
<p>If you play around with this kind of math, you'll notice that it's
perfectly consistent and satisfies all of the usual rules. The last two
examples above show how <span class="math inline">\((a / b) \cdot b =
a\)</span>; you can also see that <span class="math inline">\((a + b) +
c = a + (b + c), (a + b) \cdot c = a \cdot c + b \cdot c\)</span>, and
all the other high school algebraic identities you know and love
continue to hold true as well. In elliptic curves in reality, the points
and equations are usually computed in prime fields.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about <strong>extension fields</strong>. You have
probably already seen an extension field before; the most common example
that you encounter in math textbooks is the field of complex numbers,
where the field of real numbers is "extended" with the additional
element <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{-1} = i\)</span>. Basically,
extension fields work by taking an existing field, then "inventing" a
new element and defining the relationship between that element and
existing elements (in this case, <span class="math inline">\(i^2 + 1 =
0\)</span>), making sure that this equation does not hold true for any
number that is in the original field, and looking at the set of all
linear combinations of elements of the original field and the new
element that you have just created.</p>

</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>We can do extensions of prime fields too; for example, we can extend
the prime field <span class="math inline">\(\bmod 7\)</span> that we
described above with <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, and then we
can do:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\((2 + 3i) + (4 + 2i) = 6 + 5i\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\((5 + 2i) + 3 = 1 + 2i\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\((6 + 2i) \cdot 2 = 5 + 4i\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(4i \cdot (2 + i) = 3 + i\)</span></p>
<p>That last result may be a bit hard to figure out; what happened there
was that we first decompose the product into <span
class="math inline">\(4i \cdot 2 + 4i \cdot i\)</span>, which gives
<span class="math inline">\(8i - 4\)</span>, and then because we are
working in <span class="math inline">\(\bmod 7\)</span> math that
becomes <span class="math inline">\(i + 3\)</span>. To divide, we
do:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(a / b: (a \cdot b^{(p^2-2)})\)</span> %
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span></p>
<p>Note that the exponent for Fermat's little theorem is now <span
class="math inline">\(p^2\)</span> instead of <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, though once again if we want to be
more efficient we can also instead extend the Extended Euclidean
Algorithm to do the job. Note that <span class="math inline">\(x^{p^2 -
1} = 1\)</span> for any <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in this
field, so we call <span class="math inline">\(p^2 - 1\)</span> the
"order of the multiplicative group in the field".</p>
<p>With real numbers, the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra">Fundamental
Theorem of Algebra</a> ensures that the quadratic extension that we call
the complex numbers is "complete" — you cannot extend it further,
because for any mathematical relationship (at least, any mathematical
relationship defined by an algebraic formula) that you can come up with
between some new element <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and the
existing complex numbers, it's possible to come up with at least one
complex number that already satisfies that relationship. With prime
fields, however, we do not have this issue, and so we can go further and
make cubic extensions (where the mathematical relationship between some
new element <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> and existing field
elements is a cubic equation, so <span class="math inline">\(1,
w\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(w^2\)</span> are all linearly
independent of each other), higher-order extensions, extensions of
extensions, etc. And it is these kinds of supercharged modular complex
numbers that elliptic curve pairings are built on.</p>
<p>For those interested in seeing the exact math involved in making all
of these operations written out in code, prime fields and field
extensions are implemented here: <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/py_pairing/blob/master/py_ecc/bn128/bn128_field_elements.py">https://github.com/ethereum/py_pairing/blob/master/py_ecc/bn128/bn128_field_elements.py</a></p>
<p>Now, on to elliptic curve pairings. An elliptic curve pairing (or
rather, the specific form of pairing we'll explore here; there are also
other types of pairings, though their logic is fairly similar) is a map
<span class="math inline">\(G_2 \times G_1 \rightarrow G_t\)</span>,
where:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\bf G_1\)</span> is an elliptic
curve, where points satisfy an equation of the form <span
class="math inline">\(y^2 = x^3 + b\)</span>, and where both coordinates
are elements of <span class="math inline">\(F_p\)</span> (ie. they are
simple numbers, except arithmetic is all done modulo some prime
number)</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\bf G_2\)</span> is an elliptic
curve, where points satisfy the same equation as <span
class="math inline">\(G_1\)</span>, except where the coordinates are
elements of <span class="math inline">\((F_p)^{12}\)</span> (ie. they
are the supercharged complex numbers we talked about above; we define a
new "magic number" <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>, which is
defined by a <span class="math inline">\(12\)</span>th degree polynomial
like <span class="math inline">\(w^{12} - 18 \cdot w^6 + 82 =
0\)</span>)</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\bf G_t\)</span> is the type of
object that the result of the elliptic curve goes into. In the curves
that we look at, <span class="math inline">\(G_t\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(\bf (F_p)^{12}\)</span> (the same supercharged
complex number as used in <span
class="math inline">\(G_2\)</span>)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The main property that it must satisfy is bilinearity, which in this
context means that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(e(P, Q + R) = e(P, Q) \cdot e(P,
R)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(e(P + Q, R) = e(P, R) \cdot e(Q,
R)\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are two other important criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Efficient computability</strong> (eg. we can make an easy
pairing by simply taking the discrete logarithms of all points and
multiplying them together, but this is as computationally hard as
breaking elliptic curve cryptography in the first place, so it doesn't
count)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Non-degeneracy</strong> (sure, you could just define
<span class="math inline">\(e(P, Q) = 1\)</span>, but that's not a
particularly useful pairing)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So how do we do this?</p>
<p>The math behind why pairing functions work is quite tricky and
involves quite a bit of advanced algebra going even beyond what we've
seen so far, but I'll provide an outline. First of all, we need to
define the concept of a <strong>divisor</strong>, basically an
alternative way of representing functions on elliptic curve points. A
divisor of a function basically counts the zeroes and the infinities of
the function. To see what this means, let's go through a few examples.
Let us fix some point <span class="math inline">\(P = (P_x,
P_y)\)</span>, and consider the following function:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f(x, y) = x - P_x\)</span></p>
<p>The divisor is <span class="math inline">\([P] + [-P] - 2 \cdot
[O]\)</span> (the square brackets are used to represent the fact that we
are referring to <em>the presence of the point <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> in the set of zeroes and infinities of
the function</em>, not the point P itself; <span
class="math inline">\([P] + [Q]\)</span> is <strong>not</strong> the
same thing as <span class="math inline">\([P + Q]\)</span>). The
reasoning is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The function is equal to zero at <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, since <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> <em>is</em> <span
class="math inline">\(P_x\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(x -
P_x = 0\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>The function is equal to zero at <span
class="math inline">\(-P\)</span>, since <span
class="math inline">\(-P\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> share the same <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> coordinate</p></li>
<li><p>The function goes to infinity as <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> goes to infinity, so we say the
function is equal to infinity at <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>.
There's a technical reason why this infinity needs to be counted twice,
so <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> gets added with a
"multiplicity" of <span class="math inline">\(-2\)</span> (negative
because it's an infinity and not a zero, two because of this double
counting).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The technical reason is roughly this: because the equation of the
curve is <span class="math inline">\(x^3 = y^2 + b, y\)</span> goes to
infinity "<span class="math inline">\(1.5\)</span> times faster" than
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> does in order for <span
class="math inline">\(y^2\)</span> to keep up with <span
class="math inline">\(x^3\)</span>; hence, if a linear function includes
only <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> then it is represented as an
infinity of multiplicity <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, but if
it includes <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> then it is
represented as an infinity of multiplicity <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, consider a "line function":</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(ax + by + c = 0\)</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> are carefully chosen so that the line
passes through points <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>. Because of how elliptic curve addition
works (see the diagram at the top), this also means that it passes
through <span class="math inline">\(-P-Q\)</span>. And it goes up to
infinity dependent on both <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, so the divisor becomes <span
class="math inline">\([P]+ [Q] + [-P-Q] - 3 \cdot [O]\)</span>.</p>

<p>We know that every "rational function" (ie. a function defined only
using a finite number of <span class="math inline">\(+, -,
\cdot\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(/\)</span> operations on
the coordinates of the point) uniquely corresponds to some divisor, up
to multiplication by a constant (ie. if two functions <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> have the same divisor, then <span
class="math inline">\(F = G \cdot k\)</span> for some constant <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>).</p>
<p>For any two functions <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, the divisor of <span
class="math inline">\(F \cdot G\)</span> is equal to the divisor of
<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> plus the divisor of <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> (in math textbooks, you'll see <span
class="math inline">\((F \cdot G) = (F) + (G)\)</span>), so for example
if <span class="math inline">\(f(x, y) = P_x - x\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\((f^3) = 3 \cdot [P] + 3 \cdot [-P] - 6 \cdot
[O]\)</span>; <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(-P\)</span> are "triple-counted" to account for
the fact that <span class="math inline">\(f^3\)</span> approaches <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> at those points "three times as
quickly" in a certain mathematical sense.</p>
<p>Note that there is a theorem that states that if you "remove the
square brackets" from a divisor of a function, the points must add up to
<span class="math inline">\(O ([P] + [Q] + [-P-Q] - 3 \cdot [O]\)</span>
clearly fits, as <span class="math inline">\(P + Q - P - Q - 3 \cdot O =
O)\)</span>, and any divisor that has this property is the divisor of a
function.</p>
<p>Now, we're ready to look at Tate pairings. Consider the following
functions, defined via their divisors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\((F_P) = n \cdot [P] - n \cdot
[O]\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the order
of <span class="math inline">\(G_1\)</span>, ie. <span
class="math inline">\(n \cdot P = O\)</span> for any <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\((F_Q) = n \cdot [Q] - n \cdot
[O]\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\((g) = [P + Q] - [P] - [Q] +
[O]\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let's look at the product <span class="math inline">\(F_P \cdot
F_Q \cdot g^n\)</span>. The divisor is:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(n \cdot [P] - n \cdot [O] + n \cdot [Q] -
n \cdot [O] + n \cdot [P + Q] - n \cdot [P] - n \cdot [Q] + n \cdot
[O]\)</span></p>
<p>Which simplifies neatly to:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(n \cdot [P + Q] - n \cdot
[O]\)</span></p>
<p>Notice that this divisor is of exactly the same format as the divisor
for <span class="math inline">\(F_P\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(F_Q\)</span> above. Hence, <span
class="math inline">\(F_P \cdot F_Q \cdot g^n = F_{P + Q}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, we introduce a procedure called the "final exponentiation" step,
where we take the result of our functions above (<span
class="math inline">\(F_P, F_Q\)</span>, etc.) and raise it to the power
<span class="math inline">\(z = (p^{12} - 1) / n\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(p^{12} - 1\)</span> is the order of the
multiplicative group in <span class="math inline">\((F_p)^{12}\)</span>
(ie. for <em>any</em> <span class="math inline">\(x \in (F_p)^{12},
x^{(p^{12} - 1)} = 1\)</span>). Notice that if you apply this
exponentiation to any result that has <em>already</em> been raised to
the power of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, you get an
exponentiation to the power of <span class="math inline">\(p^{12} -
1\)</span>, so the result turns into <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Hence, after final exponentiation,
<span class="math inline">\(g^n\)</span> cancels out and we get <span
class="math inline">\(F_P^z \cdot F_Q^z = (F_{P + Q})^z\)</span>.
There's some bilinearity for you.</p>
<p>Now, if you want to make a function that's bilinear in both
arguments, you need to go into spookier math, where instead of taking
<span class="math inline">\(F_P\)</span> of a value directly, you take
<span class="math inline">\(F_P\)</span> of a <em>divisor</em>, and
that's where the full "Tate pairing" comes from. To prove some more
results you have to deal with notions like "linear equivalence" and
"Weil reciprocity", and the rabbit hole goes on from there. You can find
more reading material on all of this <a
href="http://www.math.ru.nl/~bosma/Students/MScThesis_DennisMeffert.pdf">here</a>
and <a
href="http://people.cs.nctu.edu.tw/~rjchen/ECC2012S/Elliptic%20Curves%20Number%20Theory%20And%20Cryptography%202n.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>For an implementation of a modified version of the Tate pairing,
called the optimal Ate paring, <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/py_pairing/blob/master/py_ecc/bn128/bn128_pairing.py">see
here</a>. The code implements <a
href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/notes/ep/miller.html">Miller's
algorithm</a>, which is needed to actually compute <span
class="math inline">\(F_P\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that the fact pairings like this are possible is somewhat of a
mixed blessing: on the one hand, it means that all the protocols we can
do with pairings become possible, but is also means that we have to be
more careful about what elliptic curves we use.</p>
<p>Every elliptic curve has a value called an <em>embedding degree</em>;
essentially, the smallest <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> such
that <span class="math inline">\(p^k - 1\)</span> is a multiple of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> (where <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is the prime used for the field and
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the curve order). In the
fields above, <span class="math inline">\(k = 12\)</span>, and in the
fields used for traditional ECC (ie. where we don't care about
pairings), the embedding degree is often extremely large, to the point
that pairings are computationally infeasible to compute; however, if we
are not careful then we can generate fields where <span
class="math inline">\(k = 4\)</span> or even <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(k = 1\)</span>, then the "discrete
logarithm" problem for elliptic curves (essentially, recovering <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> knowing only the point <span
class="math inline">\(P = G \cdot p\)</span>, the problem that you have
to solve to "crack" an elliptic curve private key) can be reduced into a
similar math problem over <span class="math inline">\(F_p\)</span>,
where the problem becomes much easier (this is called the <a
href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/notes/elliptic/movattack.html">MOV
attack</a>); using curves with an embedding degree of <span
class="math inline">\(12\)</span> or higher ensures that this reduction
is either unavailable, or that solving the discrete log problem over
pairing results is at least as hard as recovering a private key from a
public key "the normal way" (ie. computationally infeasible). Do not
worry; all standard curve parameters have been thoroughly checked for
this issue.</p>
