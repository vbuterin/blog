<title> STARKs, Part I: Proofs with Polynomials </title>

<p><em>Special thanks to Eli Ben-Sasson for ongoing help, explanations
and review, coming up with some of the examples used in this post, and
most crucially of all inventing a lot of this stuff; thanks to Hsiao-wei
Wang for reviewing</em></p>
<p>Hopefully many people by now have heard of <a
href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/zk-snarks-under-the-hood-b33151a013f6">ZK-SNARKs</a>,
the general-purpose succinct zero knowledge proof technology that can be
used for all sorts of usecases ranging from verifiable computation to
privacy-preserving cryptocurrency. What you might not know is that
ZK-SNARKs have a newer, shinier cousin: ZK-STARKs. With the T standing
for "transparent", ZK-STARKs resolve one of the primary weaknesses of
ZK-SNARKs, its reliance on a "trusted setup". They also come with much
simpler cryptographic assumptions, avoiding the need for elliptic
curves, pairings and the knowledge-of-exponent assumption and instead
relying purely on hashes and information theory; this also means that
they are secure even against attackers with quantum computers.</p>
<p>However, this comes at a cost: the size of a proof goes up from 288
bytes to a few hundred kilobytes. Sometimes the cost will not be worth
it, but at other times, particularly in the context of public blockchain
applications where the need for trust minimization is high, it may well
be. And if elliptic curves break or quantum computers <em>do</em> come
around, it definitely will be.</p>
<p>So how does this other kind of zero knowledge proof work? First of
all, let us review what a general-purpose succinct ZKP does. Suppose
that you have a (public) function <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, a (private) input <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and a (public) output <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. You want to prove that you know an
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(f(x) = y\)</span>, without revealing what <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is. Furthermore, for the proof to be
<em>succinct</em>, you want it to be verifiable much more quickly than
computing <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> itself.</p>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/starks-part-1-files/starks_pic1.png" style="width:350px" class="padded" />
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Let's go through a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a computation that takes
two weeks to run on a regular computer, but two hours on a data center.
You send the data center the computation (ie. the code to run <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> ), the data center runs it, and gives
back the answer <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> with a proof. You
verify the proof in a few milliseconds, and are convinced that <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> actually is the answer.</li>
<li>You have an encrypted transaction, of the form "<span
class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> was my old balance. <span
class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> was your old balance. <span
class="math inline">\(X_3\)</span> is my new balance. <span
class="math inline">\(X_4\)</span> is your new balance". You want to
create a proof that this transaction is valid (specifically, old and new
balances are non-negative, and the decrease in my balance cancels out
the increase in your balance). <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>
can be the <em>pair of encryption keys</em>, and <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> can be a function which contains as a
built-in public input the transaction, takes as input the keys, decrypts
the transaction, performs the check, and returns 1 if it passes and 0 if
it does not. <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> would of course be
1.</li>
<li>You have a blockchain like Ethereum, and you download the most
recent block. You want a proof that this block is valid, and that this
block is at the tip of a chain where every block in the chain is valid.
You ask an existing full node to provide such a proof. <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is the entire blockchain (yes, all ??
gigabytes of it), <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a function
that processes it block by block, verifies the validity and outputs the
hash of the last block, and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is
the hash of the block you just downloaded.</li>
</ul>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/starks-part-1-files/starks_pic2.png" style="width:350px" class="padded" />
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>So what's so hard about all this? As it turns out, the <em>zero
knowledge</em> (ie. privacy) guarantee is (relatively!) easy to provide;
there are a bunch of ways to convert any computation into an instance of
something like the three color graph problem, where a three-coloring of
the graph corresponds to a solution of the original problem, and then
use a traditional zero knowledge proof protocol to prove that you have a
valid graph coloring without revealing what it is. This <a
href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/11/27/zero-knowledge-proofs-illustrated-primer/">excellent
post by Matthew Green from 2014</a> describes this in some detail.</p>
<p>The much harder thing to provide is <em>succinctness</em>.
Intuitively speaking, proving things about computation succinctly is
hard because computation is <em>incredibly fragile</em>. If you have a
long and complex computation, and you as an evil genie have the ability
to flip a 0 to a 1 anywhere in the middle of the computation, then in
many cases even one flipped bit will be enough to make the computation
give a completely different result. Hence, it's hard to see how you can
do something like randomly sampling a computation trace in order to
gauge its correctness, as it's just too easy to miss that "one evil
bit". However, with some fancy math, it turns out that you can.</p>
<p>The general very high level intuition is that the protocols that
accomplish this use similar math to what is used in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasure_coding">erasure coding</a>,
which is frequently used to make <em>data</em> fault-tolerant. If you
have a piece of data, and you encode the data as a line, then you can
pick out four points on the line. Any two of those four points are
enough to reconstruct the original line, and therefore also give you the
other two points. Furthermore, if you make even the slightest change to
the data, then it is guaranteed at least three of those four points. You
can also encode the data as a degree-1,000,000 polynomial, and pick out
2,000,000 points on the polynomial; any 1,000,001 of those points will
recover the original data and therefore the other points, and any
deviation in the original data will change at least 1,000,000 points.
The algorithms shown here will make heavy use of polynomials in this way
for <em>error amplification</em>.</p>

<small>Changing even one point in the original data will lead to large
changes in a polynomial's trajectory</small>

<p><br></p>
<h3 id="a-somewhat-simple-example">A Somewhat Simple Example</h3>
<p>Suppose that you want to prove that you have a polynomial <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(P(x)\)</span> is an integer with <span
class="math inline">\(0 \leq P(x) \leq 9\)</span> for all <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> from 1 to 1 million. This is a simple
instance of the fairly common task of "range checking"; you might
imagine this kind of check being used to verify, for example, that a set
of account balances is still positive after applying some set of
transactions. If it were <span class="math inline">\(1 \leq P(x) \leq
9\)</span>, this could be part of checking that the values form a
correct Sudoku solution.</p>
<p>The "traditional" way to prove this would be to just show all
1,000,000 points, and verify it by checking the values. However, we want
to see if we can make a proof that can be verified in less than
1,000,000 steps. Simply randomly checking evaluations of <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> won't do; there's always the
possibility that a malicious prover came up with a <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> which satisfies the constraint in
999,999 places but does not satisfy it in the last one, and random
sampling only a few values will almost always miss that value. So what
<em>can</em> we do?</p>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/starks-part-1-files/starks_pic3.png" style="width:300px" class="padded" />
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Let's mathematically transform the problem somewhat. Let <span
class="math inline">\(C(x)\)</span> be a <em>constraint checking
polynomial</em>; <span class="math inline">\(C(x) = 0\)</span> if <span
class="math inline">\(0 \leq x \leq 9\)</span> and is nonzero otherwise.
There's a simple way to construct <span
class="math inline">\(C(x)\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(x \cdot
(x-1) \cdot (x-2) \cdot \ldots(x-9)\)</span> (we'll assume all of our
polynomials and other values use exclusively integers, so we don't need
to worry about numbers in between).</p>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/starks-part-1-files/starks_pic4.png" style="width:350px" class="padded" />
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now, the problem becomes: prove that you know <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(C(P(x)) = 0\)</span> for all <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> from 1 to 1,000,000. Let <span
class="math inline">\(Z(x) = (x-1) \cdot (x-2) \cdot \ldots
(x-1000000)\)</span>. It's a known mathematical fact that <em>any</em>
polynomial which equals zero at all <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> from 1 to 1,000,000 is a multiple of
<span class="math inline">\(Z(x)\)</span>. Hence, the problem can now be
transformed again: prove that you know <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(C(P(x)) = Z(x) \cdot D(x)\)</span> for all <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (note that if you know a suitable <span
class="math inline">\(C(P(x))\)</span> then dividing it by <span
class="math inline">\(Z(x)\)</span> to compute <span
class="math inline">\(D(x)\)</span> is not too difficult; you can use <a
href="http://www.purplemath.com/modules/polydiv2.htm">long polynomial
division</a> or more realistically a faster algorithm based on <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFTs</a>).
Now, we've converted our original statement into something that looks
mathematically clean and possibly quite provable.</p>
<p>So how does one prove this claim? We can imagine the proof process as
a three-step communication between a prover and a verifier: the prover
sends some information, then the verifier sends some requests, then the
prover sends some more information. First, the prover commits to (ie.
makes a Merkle tree and sends the verifier the root hash of) the
evaluations of <span class="math inline">\(P(x)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(D(x)\)</span> for all <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> from 1 to 1 billion (yes, billion).
This includes the 1 million points where <span class="math inline">\(0
\leq P(x) \leq 9\)</span> as well as the 999 million points where that
(probably) is not the case.</p>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/starks-part-1-files/starks_pic5.png" style="width:350px" class="padded" />
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>We assume the verifier already knows the evaluation of <span
class="math inline">\(Z(x)\)</span> at all of these points; the <span
class="math inline">\(Z(x)\)</span> is like a "public verification key"
for this scheme that everyone must know ahead of time (clients that do
not have the space to store <span class="math inline">\(Z(x)\)</span> in
its entirety can simply store the Merkle root of <span
class="math inline">\(Z(x)\)</span> and require the prover to also
provide branches for every <span class="math inline">\(Z(x)\)</span>
value that the verifier needs to query; alternatively, there are some
number fields over which <span class="math inline">\(Z(x)\)</span> for
certain <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is very easy to
calculate). After receiving the commitment (ie. Merkle root) the
verifier then selects a random 16 <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>
values between 1 and 1 billion, and asks the prover to provide the
Merkle branches for <span class="math inline">\(P(x)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(D(x)\)</span> there. The prover provides these
values, and the verifier checks that (i) the branches match the Merkle
root that was provided earlier, and (ii) <span
class="math inline">\(C(P(x))\)</span> actually equals <span
class="math inline">\(Z(x) \cdot D(x)\)</span> in all 16 cases.</p>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/starks-part-1-files/starks_pic6.png" style="width:350px" class="padded" />
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>We know that this proof <em>perfect completeness</em> - if you
actually know a suitable <span class="math inline">\(P(x)\)</span>, then
if you calculate <span class="math inline">\(D(x)\)</span> and construct
the proof correctly it will always pass all 16 checks. But what about
<em>soundness</em> - that is, if a malicious prover provides a bad <span
class="math inline">\(P(x)\)</span>, what is the minimum probability
that they will get caught? We can analyze as follows. Because <span
class="math inline">\(C(P(x))\)</span> is a degree-10 polynomial
composed with a degree-1,000,000 polynomial, its degree will be at most
10,000,000. In general, we know that two different degree-<span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> polynomials agree on at most <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> points; hence, a degree-10,000,000
polynomial which is not equal to any polynomial which always equals
<span class="math inline">\(Z(x) \cdot D(x)\)</span> for some <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> will necessarily disagree with them all
at at least 990,000,000 points. Hence, the probability that a bad <span
class="math inline">\(P(x)\)</span> will get caught in even one round is
already 99%; with 16 checks, the probability of getting caught goes up
to <span class="math inline">\(1 - 10^{-32}\)</span>; that is to say,
the scheme is about as hard to spoof as it is to compute a hash
collision.</p>
<p>So... what did we just do? We used polynomials to "boost" the error in
any bad solution, so that any incorrect solution to the original
problem, which would have required a million checks to find directly,
turns into a solution to the verification protocol that can get flagged
as erroneous at 99% of the time with even a single check.</p>
<p>We can convert this three-step mechanism into a <em>non-interactive
proof</em>, which can be broadcasted by a single prover once and then
verified by anyone, using the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat%E2%80%93Shamir_heuristic">Fiat-Shamir
heuristic</a>. The prover first builds up a Merkle tree of the <span
class="math inline">\(P(x)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(D(x)\)</span> values, and computes the root hash
of the tree. The root itself is then used as the source of entropy that
determines what branches of the tree the prover needs to provide. The
prover then broadcasts the Merkle root and the branches together as the
proof. The computation is all done on the prover side; the process of
computing the Merkle root from the data, and then using that to select
the branches that get audited, effectively substitutes the need for an
interactive verifier.</p>
<p>The only thing a malicious prover without a valid <span
class="math inline">\(P(x)\)</span> can do is try to make a valid proof
over and over again until eventually they get <em>extremely</em> lucky
with the branches that a Merkle root that they compute selects, but with
a soundness of <span class="math inline">\(1 - 10^{-32}\)</span> (ie.
probability of at least <span class="math inline">\(1 -
10^{-32}\)</span> that a given attempted fake proof will fail the check)
it would take a malicious prover billions of years to make a passable
proof.</p>

<h3 id="going-further">Going Further</h3>
<p>To illustrate the power of this technique, let's use it to do
something a little less trivial: prove that you know the millionth
Fibonacci number. To accomplish this, we'll prove that you have
knowledge of a polynomial which represents a computation tape, with
<span class="math inline">\(P(x)\)</span> representing the <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>th Fibonacci number. The constraint
checking polynomial will now hop across three x-coordinates: <span
class="math inline">\(C(x_1, x_2, x_3) = x_3-x_2-x_1\)</span> (notice
how if <span class="math inline">\(C(P(x), P(x+1), P(x+2)) = 0\)</span>
for all <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> then <span
class="math inline">\(P(x)\)</span> represents a Fibonacci
sequence).</p>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/starks-part-1-files/starks_pic8.png" style="width:350px" class="padded" />
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>The translated problem becomes: prove that you know <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(C(P(x), P(x+1), P(x+2)) = Z(x) \cdot
D(x)\)</span>. For each of the 16 indices that the proof audits, the
prover will need to provide Merkle branches for <span
class="math inline">\(P(x)\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(P(x+1)\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(P(x+2)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(D(x)\)</span>. The prover will additionally need
to provide Merkle branches to show that <span class="math inline">\(P(0)
= P(1) = 1\)</span>. Otherwise, the entire process is the same.</p>
<p>Now, to accomplish this in reality there are two problems that need
to be resolved. The first problem is that if we actually try to work
with regular numbers the solution would not be efficient <em>in
practice</em>, because the numbers themselves very easily get extremely
large. The millionth Fibonacci number, for example, has 208988 digits.
If we actually want to achieve succinctness in practice, instead of
doing these polynomials with regular numbers, we need to use finite
fields - number systems that still follow the same arithmetic laws we
know and love, like <span class="math inline">\(a \cdot (b+c) = (a\cdot
b) + (a\cdot c)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((a^2 - b^2) =
(a-b) \cdot (a+b)\)</span>, but where each number is guaranteed to take
up a constant amount of space. Proving claims about the millionth
Fibonacci number would then require a more complicated design that
implements big-number arithmetic <em>on top of</em> this finite field
math.</p>
<p>The simplest possible finite field is modular arithmetic; that is,
replace every instance of <span class="math inline">\(a + b\)</span>
with <span class="math inline">\(a + b \mod{N}\)</span> for some prime
<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, do the same for subtraction and
multiplication, and for division use <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse">modular
inverses</a> (eg. if <span class="math inline">\(N = 7\)</span>, then
<span class="math inline">\(3 + 4 = 0\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(2 + 6 = 1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(3
\cdot 4 = 5\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(4 / 2 = 2\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(5 / 2 = 6\)</span>). You can learn more
about these kinds of number systems from my description on prime fields
<a
href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/exploring-elliptic-curve-pairings-c73c1864e627">here</a>
(search "prime field" in the page) or this <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic">Wikipedia
article</a> on modular arithmetic (the articles that you'll find by
searching directly for "finite fields" and "prime fields" unfortunately
tend to be very complicated and go straight into abstract algebra, don't
bother with those).</p>
<p>Second, you might have noticed that in my above proof sketch for
soundness I neglected to cover one kind of attack: what if, instead of a
plausible degree-1,000,000 <span class="math inline">\(P(x)\)</span> and
degree-9,000,000 <span class="math inline">\(D(x)\)</span>, the attacker
commits to some values that are not on <em>any</em> such
relatively-low-degree polynomial? Then, the argument that an invalid
<span class="math inline">\(C(P(x))\)</span> must differ from any valid
<span class="math inline">\(C(P(x))\)</span> on at least 990 million
points does not apply, and so different and much more effective kinds of
attacks <em>are</em> possible. For example, an attacker could generate a
random value <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> for every <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, then compute <span
class="math inline">\(d = C(p) / Z(x)\)</span> and commit to these
values in place of <span class="math inline">\(P(x)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(D(x)\)</span>. These values would not be on any
kind of low-degree polynomial, but they <em>would</em> pass the
test.</p>
<p>It turns out that this possibility can be effectively defended
against, though the tools for doing so are fairly complex, and so you
can quite legitimately say that they make up the bulk of the
mathematical innovation in STARKs. Also, the solution has a limitation:
you can weed out commitments to data that are <em>very</em> far from any
degree-1,000,000 polynomial (eg. you would need to change 20% of all the
values to make it a degree-1,000,000 polynomial), but you cannot weed
out commitments to data that only differ from a polynomial in only one
or two coordinates. Hence, what these tools will provide is <em>proof of
proximity</em> - proof that <em>most</em> of the points on <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> correspond to the right kind of
polynomial.</p>
<p>As it turns out, this is sufficient to make a proof, though there are
two "catches". First, the verifier needs to check a few more indices to
make up for the additional room for error that this limitation
introduces. Second, if we are doing "boundary constraint checking" (eg.
verifying <span class="math inline">\(P(0) = P(1) = 1\)</span> in the
Fibonacci example above), then we need to extend the proof of proximity
to not only prove that most points are on the same polynomial, but also
prove that <em>those two specific points</em> (or whatever other number
of specific points you want to check) are on that polynomial.</p>
<p>In the next part of this series, I will describe the solution to
proximity checking in much more detail, and in the third part I will
describe how more complex constraint functions can be constructed to
check not just Fibonacci numbers and ranges, but also arbitrary
computation.</p>
