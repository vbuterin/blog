<p><em>This is the third part of a series of articles explaining how the
technology behind zk-SNARKs works; the previous articles on <a
href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/quadratic-arithmetic-programs-from-zero-to-hero-f6d558cea649">quadratic
arithmetic programs</a> and <a
href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/exploring-elliptic-curve-pairings-c73c1864e627">elliptic
curve pairings</a> are required reading, and this article will assume
knowledge of both concepts. Basic knowledge of what zk-SNARKs are and
what they do is also assumed. See also <a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/12/05/zksnarks-in-a-nutshell/">Christian
Reitwiessner's article here</a> for another technical
introduction.</em></p>
<p>In the previous articles, we introduced the quadratic arithmetic
program, a way of representing any computational problem with a
polynomial equation that is much more amenable to various forms of
mathematical trickery. We also introduced elliptic curve pairings, which
allow a very limited form of one-way homomorphic encryption that lets
you do equality checking. Now, we are going to start from where we left
off, and use elliptic curve pairings, together with a few other
mathematical tricks, in order to allow a prover to prove that they know
a solution for a particular QAP without revealing anything else about
the actual solution.</p>
<p>This article will focus on the <a
href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/279.pdf">Pinocchio protocol</a> by
Parno, Gentry, Howell and Raykova from 2013 (often called PGHR13); there
are a few variations on the basic mechanism, so a zk-SNARK scheme
implemented in practice may work slightly differently, but the basic
principles will in general remain the same.</p>
<p>To start off, let us go into the key cryptographic assumption
underlying the security of the mechanism that we are going to use: the
<a
href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjz1-Ht7-vRAhVEr1QKHfvtAKIQFggaMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iacr.org%2Farchive%2Fcrypto2004%2F31520273%2Fbp.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNFJk9kCq86ms46ZQVkMgAxTbPWEdg&amp;bvm=bv.145822982,d.cGw">*knowledge-of-exponent</a>*
assumption.</p>
<p><img
src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*xX1YSBNSFjmkNKR2kP-TFA.png" /></p>
<p>Basically, if you get a pair of points <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(P
\cdot k = Q\)</span>, and you get a point <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, then it is not possible to come up
with <span class="math inline">\(C \cdot k\)</span> unless <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is "derived" from <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> in some way that you know. This may
seem intuitively obvious, but this assumption actually cannot be derived
from any other assumption (eg. discrete log hardness) that we usually
use when proving security of elliptic curve-based protocols, and so
zk-SNARKs do in fact rest on a somewhat shakier foundation than elliptic
curve cryptography more generally â€” although it's still sturdy enough
that most cryptographers are okay with it.</p>
<p>Now, let's go into how this can be used. Supposed that a pair of
points <span class="math inline">\((P, Q)\)</span> falls from the sky,
where <span class="math inline">\(P \cdot k = Q\)</span>, but nobody
knows what the value of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is. Now,
suppose that I come up with a pair of points <span
class="math inline">\((R, S)\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(R \cdot k = S\)</span>. Then, the KoE assumption
implies that the only way I could have made that pair of points was by
taking <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, and multiplying both by some factor r
<em>that I personally know</em>. Note also that thanks to the magic of
elliptic curve pairings, checking that <span class="math inline">\(R = k
\cdot S\)</span> <em>doesn't actually require knowing <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> </em> - instead, you can simply check
whether or not <span class="math inline">\(e(R, Q) = e(P,
S)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let's do something more interesting. Suppose that we have ten pairs
of points fall from the sky: <span class="math inline">\((P_1, Q_1),
(P_2, Q_2)... (P_{10}, Q_{10})\)</span>. In all cases, <span
class="math inline">\(P_i \cdot k = Q_i\)</span>. Suppose that I then
provide you with a pair of points <span class="math inline">\((R,
S)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(R \cdot k = S\)</span>.
What do you know now? <em>You know that <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is some linear combination <span
class="math inline">\(P_1 \cdot i_1 + P_2 \cdot i_2 + ... + P_{10} \cdot
i_{10}\)</span>, where I know the coefficients <span
class="math inline">\(i_1, i_2 ... i_{10}\)</span>. </em>That is, the only
way to arrive at such a pair of points <span class="math inline">\((R,
S)\)</span> is to take some multiples of <span
class="math inline">\(P_1, P_2 ... P_{10}\)</span> and add them together,
and make the same calculation with <span class="math inline">\(Q_1, Q_2
... Q_{10}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that, given any specific set of <span
class="math inline">\(P_1...P_{10}\)</span> points that you might want to
check linear combinations for, you can't actually create the
accompanying <span class="math inline">\(Q_1...Q_{10}\)</span> points
without knowing what <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is, and if
you do know what <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is then you can
create a pair <span class="math inline">\((R, S)\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(R \cdot k = S\)</span> for whatever <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> you want, without bothering to create a
linear combination. Hence, for this to work it's absolutely imperative
that whoever creates those points is trustworthy and actually deletes
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> once they created the ten points.
<strong>This is where the concept of a "trusted setup" comes
from</strong>.</p>
<p>Remember that the solution to a QAP is a set of polynomials <span
class="math inline">\((A, B, C)\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(A(x) \cdot B(x) - C(x) = H(x) \cdot Z(x)\)</span>,
where:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is a linear combination of
a set of polynomials <span
class="math inline">\(\{A_1...A_m\}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is the linear combination
of <span class="math inline">\(\{B_1...B_m\}\)</span> with the same
coefficients</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is a linear combination of
<span class="math inline">\(\{C_1...C_m\}\)</span> with the same
coefficients</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The sets <span class="math inline">\(\{A_1...A_m\},
\{B_1...B_m\}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\{C_1...C_m\}\)</span> and the polynomial <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> are part of the problem statement.</p>
<p>However, in most real-world cases, <span class="math inline">\(A,
B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> are extremely
large; for something with many thousands of circuit gates like a hash
function, the polynomials (and the factors for the linear combinations)
may have many thousands of terms. Hence, instead of having the prover
provide the linear combinations directly, we are going to use the trick
that we introduced above to have the prover prove that they are
providing something which is a linear combination, but without revealing
anything else.</p>
<p>You might have noticed that the trick above works on elliptic curve
points, not polynomials. Hence, what actually happens is that we add the
following values to the trusted setup:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(G \cdot A_1(t), G \cdot A_1(t) \cdot
k_a\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(G \cdot A_2(t), G \cdot A_2(t) \cdot
k_a\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>...</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(G \cdot B_1(t), G \cdot B_1(t) \cdot
k_b\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(G \cdot B_2(t), G \cdot B_2(t) \cdot
k_b\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>...</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(G \cdot C_1(t), G \cdot C_1(t) \cdot
k_c\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(G \cdot C_2(t), G \cdot C_2(t) \cdot
k_c\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>...</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can think of t as a "secret point" at which the polynomial is
evaluated. <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a "generator" (some
random elliptic curve point that is specified as part of the protocol)
and <span class="math inline">\(t, k_a, k_b\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(k_c\)</span> are "toxic waste", numbers that
absolutely must be deleted at all costs, or else whoever has them will
be able to make fake proofs. Now, if someone gives you a pair of points
<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(P
\cdot k_a = Q\)</span> (reminder: we don't need <span
class="math inline">\(k_a\)</span> to check this, as we can do a pairing
check), then you know that what they are giving you is a linear
combination of <span class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span> polynomials
evaluated at <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p>
<p>Hence, so far the prover must give:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\pi _a = G \cdot A(t), \pi &#39;_a =
G \cdot A(t) \cdot k_a\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\pi _b = G \cdot B(t), \pi &#39;_b =
G \cdot B(t) \cdot k_b\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\pi _c = G \cdot C(t), \pi &#39;_c =
G \cdot C(t) \cdot k_c\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the prover doesn't actually need to know (and shouldn't
know!) <span class="math inline">\(t, k_a, k_b\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(k_c\)</span> to compute these values; rather, the
prover should be able to compute these values just from the points that
we're adding to the trusted setup.</p>
<p>The next step is to make sure that all three linear combinations have
the same coefficients. This we can do by adding another set of values to
the trusted setup: <span class="math inline">\(G \cdot (A_i(t) + B_i(t)
+ C_i(t)) \cdot b\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>
is another number that should be considered "toxic waste" and discarded
as soon as the trusted setup is completed. We can then have the prover
create a linear combination with these values with the same
coefficients, and use the same pairing trick as above to verify that
this value matches up with the provided <span class="math inline">\(A +
B + C\)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to prove that <span class="math inline">\(A \cdot B
- C = H \cdot Z\)</span>. We do this once again with a pairing
check:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(e(\pi _a, \pi _b) / e(\pi _c, G) ?= e(\pi
_h, G \cdot Z(t))\)</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(\pi _h= G \cdot H(t)\)</span>. If
the connection between this equation and <span class="math inline">\(A
\cdot B - C = H \cdot Z\)</span> does not make sense to you, go back and
read the <a
href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/exploring-elliptic-curve-pairings-c73c1864e627">article
on pairings</a>.</p>
<p>We saw above how to convert <span class="math inline">\(A, B\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> into elliptic curve points;
<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is just the generator (ie. the
elliptic curve point equivalent of the number one). We can add <span
class="math inline">\(G \cdot Z(t)\)</span> to the trusted setup. <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is harder; <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is just a polynomial, and we predict
very little ahead of time about what its coefficients will be for each
individual QAP solution. Hence, we need to add yet more data to the
trusted setup; specifically the sequence:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(G, G \cdot t, G \cdot t^2, G \cdot t^3, G
\cdot t^4 ...\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the Zcash trusted setup, the sequence here goes up to about 2
million; this is how many powers of <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> you need to make sure that you will
always be able to compute <span class="math inline">\(H(t)\)</span>, at
least for the specific QAP instance that they care about. And with that,
the prover can provide all of the information for the verifier to make
the final check.</p>
<p>There is one more detail that we need to discuss. Most of the time we
don't just want to prove in the abstract that some solution exists for
some specific problem; rather, we want to prove either the correctness
of some specific solution (eg. proving that if you take the word "cow"
and SHA3 hash it a million times, the final result starts with
0x73064fe5), or that a solution exists if you restrict some of the
parameters. For example, in a cryptocurrency instantiation where
transaction amounts and account balances are encrypted, you want to
prove that you know some decryption key k such that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><code>decrypt(old_balance, k) &gt;= decrypt(tx_value, k)</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>decrypt(old_balance, k) - decrypt(tx_value, k) = decrypt(new_balance, k)</code></p></li>
</ol>
<p>The encrypted <code>old_balance</code>, <code>tx_value</code> and
<code>new_balance</code> should be specified publicly, as those are the
specific values that we are looking to verify at that particular time;
only the decryption key should be hidden. Some slight modifications to
the protocol are needed to create a "custom verification key" that
corresponds to some specific restriction on the inputs.</p>
<p>Now, let's step back a bit. First of all, here's the verification
algorithm in its entirety, courtesy of ben <a
href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/879.pdf">Sasson, Tromer, Virza and
Chiesa</a>:</p>
<p><img
src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*gOI0njM1tPSvmvZuIUe0MA.png"
class="padded" /></p>
<p>The first line deals with parametrization; essentially, you can think
of its function as being to create a "custom verification key" <em>for
the specific instance of the problem</em> where some of the arguments
are specified. The second line is the linear combination check for <span
class="math inline">\(A, B\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span>; the third line is the check that the
linear combinations have the same coefficients, and the fourth line is
the product check <span class="math inline">\(A \cdot B - C = H \cdot
Z\)</span>.</p>
<p>Altogether, the verification process is a few elliptic curve
multiplications (one for each "public" input variable), and five pairing
checks, one of which includes an additional pairing multiplication. The
proof contains eight elliptic curve points: a pair of points each for
<span class="math inline">\(A(t), B(t)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(C(t)\)</span>, a point <span
class="math inline">\(\pi _k\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(b
\cdot (A(t) + B(t) + C(t))\)</span>, and a point <span
class="math inline">\(\pi _h\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(H(t)\)</span>. Seven of these points are on the
<span class="math inline">\(F_p\)</span> curve (32 bytes each, as you
can compress the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> coordinate to a
single bit), and in the Zcash implementation one point (<span
class="math inline">\(\pi _b\)</span>) is on the twisted curve in <span
class="math inline">\(F_{p^2}\)</span> (64 bytes), so the total size of
the proof is ~288 bytes.</p>
<p>The two computationally hardest parts of creating a proof are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Dividing <span class="math inline">\((A \cdot B - C) / Z\)</span>
to get <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> (algorithms based on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">Fast
Fourier transform</a> can do this in sub-quadratic time, but it's still
quite computationally intensive)</p></li>
<li><p>Making the elliptic curve multiplications and additions to create
the <span class="math inline">\(A(t), B(t), C(t)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(H(t)\)</span> values and their corresponding
pairs</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The basic reason why creating a proof is so hard is the fact that
what was a single binary logic gate in the original computation turns
into an operation that must be cryptographically processed through
elliptic curve operations if we are making a zero-knowledge proof out of
it. This fact, together with the superlinearity of fast Fourier
transforms, means that proof creation takes ~20â€“40 seconds for a Zcash
transaction.</p>
<p>Another very important question is: can we try to make the trusted
setup a little... less trust-demanding? Unfortunately we can't make it
completely trustless; the KoE assumption itself precludes making
independent pairs <span class="math inline">\((P_i, P_i \cdot
k)\)</span> without knowing what <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>
is. However, we can increase security greatly by using <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-of-<span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> multiparty computation - that is,
constructing the trusted setup between <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> parties in such a way that as long as
at least one of the participants deleted their toxic waste then you're
okay.</p>
<p>To get a bit of a feel for how you would do this, here's a simple
algorithm for taking an existing set (<span class="math inline">\(G, G
\cdot t, G \cdot t^2, G \cdot t^3...\)</span>), and "adding in" your own
secret so that you need both your secret and the previous secret (or
previous set of secrets) to cheat.</p>
<p>The output set is simply:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(G, (G \cdot t) \cdot s, (G \cdot t^2)
\cdot s^2, (G \cdot t^3) \cdot s^3...\)</span></p>
<p>Note that you can produce this set knowing only the original set and
s, and the new set functions in the same way as the old set, except now
using <span class="math inline">\(t \cdot s\)</span> as the "toxic
waste" instead of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. As long as you
and the person (or people) who created the previous set do not both fail
to delete your toxic waste and later collude, the set is "safe".</p>
<p>Doing this for the complete trusted setup is quite a bit harder, as
there are several values involved, and the algorithm has to be done
between the parties in several rounds. It's an area of active research
to see if the multi-party computation algorithm can be simplified
further and made to require fewer rounds or made more parallelizable, as
the more you can do that the more parties it becomes feasible to include
into the trusted setup procedure. It's reasonable to see why a trusted
setup between six participants who all know and work with each other
might make some people uncomfortable, but a trusted setup with thousands
of participants would be nearly indistinguishable from no trust at all -
and if you're really paranoid, you can get in and participate in the
setup procedure yourself, and be sure that you personally deleted your
value.</p>
<p>Another area of active research is the use of other approaches that
do not use pairings and the same trusted setup paradigm to achieve the
same goal; see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJ9K_o-RRSY">Eli
ben Sasson's recent presentation</a> for one alternative (though be
warned, it's at least as mathematically complicated as SNARKs are!)</p>
