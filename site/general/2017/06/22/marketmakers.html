<title> On Path Independence </title>

<p>Suppose that someone walks up to you and starts exclaiming to you
that he thinks he has figured out how to create a source of unlimited
free energy. His scheme looks as follows. First, you get a spaceship up
to low Earth orbit. There, Earth's gravity is fairly high, and so the
spaceship will start to accelerate heavily toward the earth. The
spaceship puts itself into a trajectory so that it barely brushes past
the Earth's atmosphere, and then keeps hurtling far into space. Further
in space, the gravity is lower, and so the spaceship can go higher
before it starts once again coming down. When it comes down, it takes a
curved path toward the Earth, so as to maximize its time in low orbit,
maximizing the acceleration it gets from the high gravity there, so that
after it passes by the Earth it goes even higher. After it goes high
enough, it flies through the Earth's atmosphere, slowing itself down but
using the waste heat to power a thermal reactor. Then, it would go back
to step one and keep going.</p>
<p>Something like this:</p>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/marketmakers-files/indep_diag1.png" style="width:450px" />
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now, if you know anything about Newtonian dynamics, chances are
you'll immediately recognize that this scheme is total bollocks. But how
do you know? You could make an appeal to symmetry, saying "look, for
every slice of the orbital path where you say gravity gives you high
acceleration, there's a corresponding slice of the orbital path where
gravity gives you just as high deceleration, so I don't see where the
net gains are coming from". But then, suppose the man presses you. "Ah,"
he says, "but in that slice where there is high acceleration your
initial velocity is low, and so you spend a lot of time inside of it,
whereas in the corresponding slice, your incoming velocity is high, and
so you have less time to decelerate". How do you really, conclusively,
prove him wrong?</p>
<p>One approach is to dig deeply into the math, calculate the integrals,
and show that the supposed net gains are in fact exactly equal to zero.
But there is also a simple approach: recognize that <strong>energy is
path-independent</strong>. That is, when the spaceship moves from point
<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to point <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, where point <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is closer to the earth, its kinetic
energy certainly goes up because its speed increases. But because total
energy (kinetic plus potential) <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy">is
conserved</a>, and potential energy is only dependent on the spaceship's
<em>position</em>, and not how it got there, we know that regardless of
what path from point <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to point
<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> the spaceship takes, once it gets
to point <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> <em>the total change in
kinetic energy will be exactly the same</em>.</p>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/marketmakers-files/indep_diag2.png" style="width:350px" /><br><br>
<small>Different paths, same change in energy </small>
</center>
<p><br> Furthermore, we know that the kinetic energy gain from going
<em>from point <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to point <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span></em> is also independent of the path
you take along the way: in all cases it's exactly zero. <br> One <a
href="https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@hms10/bancor-is-flawed">concern</a>
sometimes <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/55m04x/lets_run_onchain_decentralized_exchanges_the_way/d8bw7iw/">cited</a>
against on-chain market makers (that is, fully automated on-chain
mechanisms that act as always-available counterparties for people who
wish to trade one type of token for another) is that they are invariably
easy to exploit.</p>
<p>As an example, let me quote a <a
href="http://hackingdistributed.com/2017/06/19/bancor-is-flawed/">recent
post</a> discussing this issue in the context of Bancor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The prices that Bancor offers for tokens have nothing to do with the
actual market equilibrium. Bancor will always trail the market, and in
doing so, will bleed its reserves. A simple thought experiment suffices
to illustrate the problem. Suppose that market panic sets around X.
Unfounded news about your system overtake social media. Let's suppose
that people got convinced that your CEO has absconded to a remote island
with no extradition treaty, that your CFO has been embezzling money, and
your CTO was buying drugs from the darknet markets and shipping them to
his work address to make a Scarface-like mound of white powder on his
desk. Worse, let's suppose that you know these allegations to be false.
They were spread by a troll army wielded by a company with no products,
whose business plan is to block everyone's coin stream. Bancor would
offer ever decreasing prices for X coins during a bank run, until it has
no reserves left. You'd watch the market panic take hold and eat away
your reserves. Recall that people are convinced that the true value of X
is 0 in this scenario, and the Bancor formula is guaranteed to offer a
price above that. So your entire reserve would be gone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The post discusses many issues around the Bancor protocol, including
details such as code quality, and I will not touch on any of those;
instead, I will focus purely on the topic of on-chain market maker
efficiency and exploitability, using Bancor (along with MKR) purely as
examples and not seeing to make any judgements on the quality of either
project as a whole.</p>
<p>For many classes of naively designed on-chain market makers, the
comment above about exploitability and trailing markets applies
verbatim, and quite seriously so. However, there are also classes of
on-chain market makers that are definitely not suspect to their entire
reserve being drained due to some kind of money-pumping attack. To take
a simple example, consider the market maker selling MKR for ETH whose
internal state consists of a current price, <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, and which is willing to buy or sell an
infinitesimal amount of MKR at each price level. For example, suppose
that <span class="math inline">\(p = 5\)</span>, and you wanted to buy 2
MKR. The market would sell you:</p>
<ul>
<li>0.00...01 MKR at a price of 5 ETH/MKR</li>
<li>0.00...01 MKR at a price of 5.00...01 ETH/MKR</li>
<li>0.00...01 MKR at a price of 5.00...02 ETH/MKR</li>
<li>....</li>
<li>0.00...01 MKR at a price of 6.99...98 ETH/MKR</li>
<li>0.00...01 MKR at a price of 6.99...99 ETH/MKR</li>
</ul>
<p>Altogether, it's selling you 2 MKR at an average price of 6 ETH/MKR
(ie. total cost 12 ETH), and at the end of the operation <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> has increased to 7. If someone
<em>then</em> wanted to sell 1 MKR, they would be spending 6.5 ETH, and
at the end of <em>that</em> operation <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> would drop back down to 6.</p>
<p>Now, suppose that I told you that such a market maker started off at
a price of <span class="math inline">\(p = 5\)</span>, and after an
unspecified series of events <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is
now 4. Two questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How much MKR did the market maker gain or lose?</li>
<li>How much ETH did the market maker gain or lose?</li>
</ol>
<p>The answers are: it gained 1 MKR, and lost 4.5 ETH. Notice that this
result is totally independent of the path that <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> took. Those answers are correct if
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> went from 5 to 4 directly with
one buyer, they're correct if there was first one buyer that took <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> from 5 to 4.7 and a second buyer that
took <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> the rest of the way to 4,
and they're even correct if <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> first
dropped to 2, then increased to 9.818, then dropped again to 0.53, then
finally rose again to 4.</p>
<p>Why is this the case? The simplest way to see this is to see that if
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> drops below 4 and then comes back
up to 4, the sells on the way down are exactly counterbalanced by buys
on the way up; each sell has a corresponding buy of the same magnitude
at the exact same price. But we can also see this by viewing the market
maker's core mechanism differently. Define the market maker as having a
<em>single-dimensional</em> internal state <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, and having MKR and ETH balances
defined by the following formulas:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(mkr\_balance(p) = 10 - p\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(eth\_balance(p) = p^2/2\)</span></p>
<p>Anyone has the power to "edit" <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
(though only to values between 0 and 10), but they can only do so by
supplying the right amount of MKR or ETH, and getting the right amount
of MKR and ETH back, so that the balances still match up; that is, so
that the amount of MKR and ETH held by the market maker after the
operation is the amount that they are supposed to hold according to the
above formulas, with the new value for <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> that was set. Any edit to <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> that does not come with MKR and ETH
transactions that make the balances match up automatically fails.</p>
<p>Now, the fact that any series of events that drops <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> from 5 to 4 also raises the market
maker's MKR balance by 1 and drops its ETH balance by 4.5, regardless of
what series of events it was, should look elementary: <span
class="math inline">\(mkr\_balance(4) - mkr\_balance(5) = 1\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(eth\_balance(4) - eth\_balance(5) =
-4.5\)</span>.</p>
<p>What this means is that a "reserve bleeding" attack on a market maker
that preserves this kind of path independence property is impossible.
Even if some trolls successfully create a market panic that drops prices
to near-zero, when the panic subsides, and prices return to their
original levels, the market maker's position will be unchanged - even if
both the price, and the market maker's balances, made a bunch of crazy
moves in the meantime.</p>
<p>Now, this does not mean that market makers cannot lose money,
compared to other holding strategies. If, when you start off, 1 MKR = 5
ETH, and then the MKR price moves, and we compare the performance of
holding 5 MKR and 12.5 ETH in the market maker versus the performance of
just holding the assets, the result looks like this:</p>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/marketmakers-files/marketmaker.png" style="width:550px"></img>
</center>
<p>Holding a balanced portfolio always wins, except in the case where
prices stay exactly the same, in which case the returns of the market
maker and the balanced portfolio are equal. Hence, the purpose of a
market maker of this type is to subsidize guaranteed liquidity as a
public good for users, serving as trader of last resort, and not to earn
revenue. However, we certainly can modify the market maker to earn
revenue, and quite simply: we have it charge a spread. That is, the
market maker might charge <span class="math inline">\(1.005\cdot
p\)</span> for buys and offer only <span
class="math inline">\(0.995\cdot p\)</span> for sells. Now, being the
beneficiary of a market maker becomes a bet: if, in the long run, prices
tend to move in one direction, then the market maker loses, at least
relative to what they could have gained if they had a balanced
portfolio. If, on the other hand, prices tend to bounce around wildly
but ultimately come back to the same point, then the market maker can
earn a nice profit. This sacrifices the "path independence" property,
but in such a way that any deviations from path independence are always
in the market maker's favor.</p>
<p>There are many designs that path-independent market makers could
take; if you are willing to create a token that can issue an unlimited
quantity of units, then the "constant reserve ratio" mechanism (where
for some constant ratio <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq r \leq
1\)</span>, the token supply is <span class="math inline">\(p^{1/r -
1}\)</span> and the reserve size is <span class="math inline">\(r \cdot
p^{1/r}\)</span> also counts as one, provided that it is implemented
correctly and path independence is not compromised by bounds and
rounding errors.</p>
<p>If you want to make a market maker for existing tokens without a
price cap, my favorite (credit to Martin Koppelmann) mechanism is that
which maintains the invariant <span
class="math inline">\(tokenA\_balance(p) \cdot tokenB\_balance(p) =
k\)</span> for some constant <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. So
the formulas would be:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(tokenA\_balance(p) = \sqrt{k\cdot
p}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(tokenB\_balance(p) =
\sqrt{k/p}\)</span></p>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/marketmakers-files/indep_diag3.png" style="width:350px"></img><br>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is the price of <span
class="math inline">\(tokenB\)</span> denominated in <span
class="math inline">\(tokenA\)</span>. In general, you can make a
path-independent market maker by defining any (monotonic) relation
between <span class="math inline">\(tokenA\_balance\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(tokenB\_balance\)</span> and calculating its
derivative at any point to give the price.</p>
<p><br> The above only discusses the role of path independence in
preventing one particular type of issue: that where an attacker somehow
makes a series of transactions in the context of a series of price
movements in order to repeatedly drain the market maker of money. With a
path independent market maker, such "money pump" vulnerabilities are
impossible. However, there certainly are <em>other</em> kinds of
inefficiencies that may exist. If the price of MKR drops from 5 ETH to 1
ETH, then the market maker used in the example above will have lost 28
ETH worth of value, whereas a balanced portfolio would only have lost 20
ETH. Where did that 8 ETH go?</p>
<p>In the best case, the price (that is to say, the "real" price, the
price level where supply and demand among all users and traders matches
up) drops quickly, and some lucky trader snaps up the deal, claiming an
8 ETH profit minus negligible transaction fees. But what if there are
multiple traders? Then, if the price between block <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and block <span
class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> differs, the fact that traders can
bid against each other by setting transaction fees creates an all-pay
auction, with revenues going to the miner. As a consequence of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_equivalence">revenue
equivalence theorem</a>, we can deduce that we can expect that the
transaction fees that traders send into this mechanism will keep going
up until they are roughly equal to the size of the profit earned (at
least initially; the <em>real</em> equilibrium is for miners to just
snap up the money themselves). Hence, either way schemes like this are
ultimately a gift to the miners.</p>
<p>One way to increase social welfare in such a design is to make it
possible to create purchase transactions that are only worthwhile for
miners to include if they actually make the purchase. That is, if the
"real" price of MKR falls from 5 to 4.9, and there are 50 traders racing
to arbitrage the market maker, and only the first one of those 50 will
make the trade, then only that one should pay the miner a transaction
fee. This way, the other 49 failed trades will not clog up the
blockchain. <a href="http://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/208">EIP
86</a>, slated for Metropolis, opens up a path toward standardizing such
a conditional transaction fee mechanism (another good side effect is
that this can also make token sales more unobtrusive, as similar
all-pay-auction mechanics apply in many token sales).</p>
<p>Additionally, there are other inefficiencies if the market maker is
the <em>only</em> available trading venue for tokens. For example, if
two traders want to exchange a large amount, then they would need to do
so via a long series of small buy and sell transactions, needlessly
clogging up the blockchain. To mitigate such efficiencies, an on-chain
market maker should only be <em>one</em> of the trading venues
available, and not the only one. However, this is arguably not a large
concern for protocol developers; if there ends up being a demand for a
venue for facilitating large-scale trades, then someone else will likely
provide it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the arguments here only talk about path independence of
the market maker <em>assuming</em> a given starting price and ending
price. However, because of various psychological effects, as well as
multi-equilibrium effects, the ending price is plausibly a function not
just of the starting price and recent events that affect the
"fundamental" value of the asset, but also of the pattern of trades that
happens in response to those events. If a price-dropping event takes
place, and because of poor liquidity the price of the asset drops
quickly, it may end up recovering to a lower point than if more
liquidity had been present in the first place. That said, this may
actually be an argument in favor of subsidied market makers: if such
multiplier effects exist, then they will have a positive impact on price
stability that goes beyond the first-order effect of the liquidity that
the market maker itself provides.</p>
<p>There is likely a lot of research to be done in determining exactly
which path-independent market maker is optimal. There is also the
possibility of hybrid semi-automated market makers that have the same
guaranteed-liquidity properties, but which include some element of
asynchrony, as well as the ability for the operator to "cut in line" and
collect the profits in cases where large amounts of capital would
otherwise be lost to miners. There is also not yet a coherent theory of
just how much (if any) on-chain automated guaranteed liquidity is
optimal for various objectives, and to what extent, and by whom, these
market makers should be subsidized. All in all, the on-chain mechanism
design space is still in its early days, and it's certainly worth much
more broadly researching and exploring various options.</p>
