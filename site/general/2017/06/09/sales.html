<title> Analyzing Token Sale Models </title>

<p><small><b>Note: I mention the names of various projects below only to
compare and contrast their token sale mechanisms; this should NOT be
taken as an endorsement or criticism of any specific project as a whole.
It's entirely possible for any given project to be total trash as a
whole and yet still have an awesome token sale model.</b></small></p>
<p>The last few months have seen an increasing amount of innovation in
token sale models. Two years ago, the space was simple: there were
capped sales, which sold a fixed number of tokens at a fixed price and
hence fixed valuation and would often quickly sell out, and there were
uncapped sales, which sold as many tokens as people were willing to buy.
Now, we have been seeing a surge of interest, both in terms of
theoretical investigation and in many cases real-world implementation,
of hybrid capped sales, reverse dutch auctions, Vickrey auctions,
proportional refunds, and many other mechanisms.</p>
<p>Many of these mechanisms have arisen as responses to perceived
failures in previous designs. Nearly every significant sale, including
Brave's Basic Attention Tokens, Gnosis, upcoming sales such as Bancor,
and older ones such as Maidsafe and even the Ethereum sale itself, has
been met with a substantial amount of criticism, all of which points to
a simple fact: so far, we have still not yet discovered a mechanism that
has all, or even most, of the properties that we would like.</p>
<p>Let us review a few examples.</p>
<h4 id="maidsafe">Maidsafe</h4>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/sales-files/msc_chart.png" width="350px" class="padded" />
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>The <a href="http://maidsafe.net/">decentralized internet
platform</a> raised $7m <a
href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/06/03/mastercoin-maidsafe-crowdsale/#7fda1c71207d">in
five hours</a>. However, they made the mistake of accepting payment in
two currencies (BTC and MSC), and giving a favorable rate to MSC buyers.
This <a
href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/maidsafe-embroiled-safecoin-presale-mastercoin-pump-dump/">led
to</a> a temporary ~2x appreciation in the MSC price, as users rushed in
to buy MSC to participate in the sale at the more favorable rate, but
then the price saw a similarly steep drop after the sale ended. Many
users converted their BTC to MSC to participate in the sale, but then
the sale closed too quickly for them, leading to them being stuck with a
~30% loss.</p>
<p>This sale, and several others after it (cough cough <a
href="https://blog.wetrust.io/eth-and-btc-contribution-dcd16876bf28">WeTrust</a>,
<a
href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/ethereum-based-debit-card-tokencard-ico-raises-12-7-million-30-minutes/">TokenCard</a>),
showed a lesson that should hopefully by now be uncontroversial: running
a sale that accepts multiple currencies at a fixed exchange rate is
dangerous and bad. Don't do it.</p>
<h4 id="ethereum">Ethereum</h4>
<p>The Ethereum sale was uncapped, and ran for 42 days. The sale price
was 2000 ETH for 1 BTC for the first 14 days, and then started
increasing linearly, finishing at 1337 ETH for 1 BTC.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*zl1MuV2-RoVzs8X1HOleJA.png" width="550px" class="padded" />
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Nearly every uncapped sale is criticized for being "greedy" (a
criticism I have significant reservations about, but we'll get back to
this later), though there is also another more interesting criticism of
these sales: they give participants <em>high uncertainty about the
valuation</em> that they are buying at. To use a not-yet-started sale as
a example, there are likely many people who would be willing to pay
$10,000 for a pile of Bancor tokens if they knew for a fact that this
pile represented 1% of all Bancor tokens in existence, but many of them
would become quite apprehensive if they were buying a pile of, say, 5000
Bancor tokens, and they had no idea whether the total supply would be
50000, 500000 or 500 million.</p>
<p>In the Ethereum sale, buyers who really cared about predictability of
valuation generally bought on the 14th day, reasoning that this was the
last day of the full discount period and so on this day they had maximum
predictability together with the full discount, but the pattern above is
hardly economically optimal behavior; the equilibrium would be something
like everyone buying in on the last hour of the 14th day, making a
private tradeoff between certainty of valuation and taking the 1.5% hit
(or, if certainty was really important, purchases could spill over into
the 15th, 16th and later days). Hence, the model certainly has some
rather weird economic properties that we would really like to avoid if
there is a convenient way to do so.</p>
<h4 id="bat">BAT</h4>
<p>Throughout 2016 and early 2017, the capped sale design was most
popular. Capped sales have the property that it is very likely that
interest is oversubscribed, and so there is a large incentive to getting
in first. Initially, sales took a few hours to finish. However, soon the
speed began to accelerate. First Blood made a lot of news by finishing
their $5.5m sale in <a
href="http://themerkle.com/ethereum-based-esports-platform-firstblood-raises-us5-5m-in-mere-minutes/">two
minutes</a> - <em>while <a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/09/22/ethereum-network-currently-undergoing-dos-attack/">active
denial-of-service attacks</a> on the Ethereum blockchain were taking
place</em>. However, the apotheosis of this race-to-the-Nash-equilibrium
did not come until the BAT sale last month, when a <a
href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/01/brave-ico-35-million-30-seconds-brendan-eich/">$35m
sale was completed within 30 seconds</a> due to the large amount of
interest in the project.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WHr0X7TZL6Rzn0sg3_R-Aw.png" width="550px"></img>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Not only did the sale finish within two blocks, but also:</p>
<ul>
<li>The total transaction fees paid were <a
href="https://medium.com/the-bitcoin-podcast-blog/a-look-at-the-bat-token-distribution-bb3bcb92748f">70.15
ETH</a> (&gt;$15,000), with the highest single fee being ~$6,600</li>
<li>185 purchases were successful, and over 10,000 failed</li>
<li>The Ethereum blockchain's capacity was full for 3 hours after the
sale started</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, we are starting to see capped sales approach their natural
equilibrium: people trying to outbid each other's transaction fees, to
the point where potentially millions of dollars of surplus would be
burned into the hands of miners. And that's before the next stage
starts: large mining pools butting into the start of the line and just
buying up all of the tokens themselves before anyone else can.</p>
<h4 id="gnosis">Gnosis</h4>
<p>The Gnosis sale attempted to alleviate these issues with a novel
mechanism: the reverse dutch auction. The terms, in simplified form, are
as follows. There was a capped sale, with a cap of $12.5 million USD.
However, the portion of tokens that would actually be given to
purchasers depended on how long the sale took to finish. If it finished
on the first day, then only ~5% of tokens would be distributed among
purchasers, and the rest held by the Gnosis team; if it finished on the
second day, it would be ~10%, and so forth.</p>
<p>The purpose of this is to create a scheme where, if you buy at time
<span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, then you are guaranteed to buy
in at a valuation which is at most <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{T}\)</span>.</p>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/sales-files/gnosis_auction.png" width="550px"></img>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>The goal is to create a mechanism where the optimal strategy is
simple. First, you personally decide what is the highest valuation you
would be willing to buy at (call it V). Then, when the sale starts, you
don't buy in immediately; rather, you wait until the valuation drops to
below that level, and then send your transaction.</p>
<p>There are two possible outcomes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The sale closes before the valuation drops to below V. Then, you are
happy because you stayed out of what you thought is a bad deal.</li>
<li>The sale closes after the valuation drops to below V. Then, you sent
your transaction, and you are happy because you got into what you
thought is a good deal.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, many people predicted that because of "fear of missing out"
(FOMO), many people would just "irrationally" buy in at the first day,
without even looking at the valuation. And this is exactly what
happened: the sale finished in a few hours, with the result that the
sale reached its cap of $12.5 million when it was only selling about 5%
of all tokens that would be in existence - an implied valuation of <a
href="http://www.trustnodes.com/2017/04/24/ethereum-based-gnosis-ico-sells-10-minutes-300-million-evaluation">over
$300 million</a>.</p>
<p>All of this would of course be an excellent piece of confirming
evidence for the narrative that markets are totally irrational, people
don't think clearly before throwing in large quantities of money (and
often, as a subtext, that the entire space needs to be somehow
suppressed to prevent further exuberance) if it weren't for one
inconvenient fact: <strong><em>the traders who bought into the sale were
right</em></strong>.</p>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/sales-files/gnosis_price_pic.png" width="550px" class="padded" />
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Even in ETH terms, despite the massive ETH price rise, the price of 1
GNO has increased from ~0.6 ETH to ~0.8 ETH.</p>
<p>What happened? A couple of weeks before the sale started, facing
public criticism that if they end up holding the majority of the coins
they would act like a central bank with the ability to heavily
manipulate GNO prices, the Gnosis team agreed to hold 90% of the coins
that were not sold for a year. From a trader's point of view, coins that
are locked up for a long time are coins that cannot affect the market,
and so in a short term analysis, might as well not exist. This is what
initially propped up Steem to such a high valuation <a
href="http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/steem/#charts">last year in
July</a>, as well as Zcash in the very early moments when the price of
each coin <a
href="http://www.coindesk.com/what-is-the-value-zcash-market-searches-answers/">was
over $1,000</a>.</p>
<p>Now, one year is not <em>that</em> long a time, and locking up coins
for a year is nowhere close to the same thing as locking them up
forever. However, the reasoning goes further. Even after the one year
holding period expires, you can argue that it is in the Gnosis team's
interest to only release the locked coins if they believe that doing so
will make the price go up, and so if you trust the Gnosis team's
judgement this means that they are going to do something <em>which is at
least as good for the GNO price as simply locking up the coins
forever</em>. Hence, in reality, the GNO sale was really much more like
a capped sale with a cap of $12.5 million and a valuation of $37.5
million. And the traders who participated in the sale reacted exactly as
they should have, leaving scores of internet commentators wondering what
just happened.</p>
<p>There is certainly a weird bubbliness about crypto-assets, with <a
href="http://coinmarketcap.com/">various no-name assets</a> attaining
market caps of $1-100 million (including <a
href="http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitbean/">BitBean</a> as of
the time of this writing at $12m, <a
href="http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/potcoin/">PotCoin</a> at $22m,
<a href="http://coinmarketcap.com/assets/pepe-cash/">PepeCash</a> at
$13m and <a
href="http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/smileycoin/">SmileyCoin</a> at
$14.7m) just because. However, there's a strong case to be made that the
participants <em>at the sale stage</em> are in many cases doing nothing
wrong, at least for themselves; rather, traders who buy in sales are
simply (correctly) predicting the existence of an ongoing bubble has
been brewing since the start of 2015 (and arguably, since the start of
2010).</p>
<p>More importantly though, bubble behavior aside, there is another
legitimate criticism of the Gnosis sale: despite their 1-year no-selling
promise, eventually they will have access to the entirety of their
coins, and they <strong>will</strong> to a limited extent be able to act
like a central bank with the ability to heavily manipulate GNO prices,
and traders will have to deal with all of the monetary policy
uncertainty that that entails.</p>
<h3 id="specifying-the-problem">Specifying the problem</h3>
<p>So what would a <strong>good</strong> token sale mechanism look like?
One way that we can start off is by looking through the criticisms of
existing sale models that we have seen and coming up with a list of
desired properties.</p>
<p>Let's do that. Some natural properties include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Certainty of valuation</strong> - if you participate in a
sale, you should have certainty over at least a ceiling on the valuation
(or, in other words, a floor on the percentage of all tokens you are
getting).</li>
<li><strong>Certainty of participation</strong> - if you try to
participate in a sale, you should be able to generally count on
succeeding.</li>
<li><strong>Capping the amount raised</strong> - to avoid being
perceived as greedy (or possibly to mitigate risk of regulatory
attention), the sale should have a limit on the amount of money it is
collecting.</li>
<li><strong>No central banking</strong> - the token sale issuer should
not be able to end up with an unexpectedly very large percentage of the
tokens that would give them control over the market.</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency</strong> - the sale should not lead to
substantial economic inefficiencies or deadweight losses.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sounds reasonable?</p>
<p>Well, here's the not-so-fun part.</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) and (2) cannot be fully satisfied simultaneously.</li>
<li>At least without resorting to very clever tricks, (3), (4) and (5)
cannot be satisfied simultaneously.</li>
</ul>
<p>These can be cited as "the first token sale dilemma" and "the second
token sale trilemma".</p>
<p>The proof for the first dilemma is easy: suppose you have a sale
where you provide users with certainty of a $100 million valuation. Now,
suppose that users try to throw $101 million into the sale. At least
some will fail. The proof for the second trilemma is a simple
supply-and-demand argument. If you satisfy (4), then you are selling
all, or some fixed large percentage, of the tokens, and so the valuation
you are selling at is proportional to the price you are selling at. If
you satisfy (3), then you are putting a cap on the price. However, this
implies the possibility that the equilibrium price at the quantity you
are selling exceeds the price cap that you set, and so you get a
shortage, which inevitably leads to either (i) the digital equivalent of
standing in line for 4 hours at a very popular restaurant, or (ii) the
digital equivalent of ticket scalping - both large deadwight losses,
contradicting (5).</p>
<p>The first dilemma cannot be overcome; some valuation uncertainty or
participation uncertainty is inescapable, though when the choice exists
it seems better to try to choose participation uncertainty rather than
valuation uncertainty. The closest that we can come is compromising on
<em>full participation</em> to <em>guarantee</em> partial participation.
This can be done with a proportional refund (eg. if $101 million buy in
at a $100 million valuation, then everyone gets a 1% refund). We can
also think of this mechanism as being an uncapped sale where part of the
payment comes in the form of <em>locking up</em> capital rather than
spending it; from this viewpoint, however, it becomes clear that the
requirement to lock up capital is an efficiency loss, and so such a
mechanism fails to satisfy (5). If ether holdings are not
well-distributed then it arguably harms fairness by favoring wealthy
stakeholders.</p>
<p>The second dilemma is difficult to overcome, and many attempts to
overcome it can easily fail or backfire. For example, the Bancor sale is
considering limiting the transaction gas price for purchases to 50
shannon (~12x the normal gasprice). However, this now means that the
optimal strategy for a buyer is to set up a large number of accounts,
and from each of those accounts send a transaction that triggers a
contract, which then attempts to buy in (the indirection is there to
make it impossible for the buyer to accidentally buy in more than they
wanted, and to reduce capital requirements). The more accounts a buyer
sets up, the more likely they are to get in. Hence, in equilibrium, this
could lead to <em>even more</em> clogging of the Ethereum blockchain
than a BAT-style sale, where at least the $6600 fees were spent on a
single transaction and not an entire denial-of-service attack on the
network. Furthermore, any kind of on-chain transaction spam contest
severely harms fairness, because the cost of participating in the
contest is constant, whereas the reward is proportional to how much
money you have, and so the result disproportionately favors wealthy
stakeholders.</p>
<h3 id="moving-forward">Moving forward</h3>
<p>There are three more clever things that you can do. First, you can do
a reverse dutch auction just like Gnosis, but with one change: instead
of holding the unsold tokens, put them toward some kind of public good.
Simple examples include: (i) airdrop (ie. redistributing to all ETH
holders), (ii) donating to the <a
href="https://ethereum.org/donate">Ethereum Foundation</a>, (iii)
donating to <a href="http://parity.io">Parity</a>, <a
href="http://www.brainbot.com/">Brainbot</a>, <a
href="http://smartpool.io/">Smartpool</a> or other companies and
individuals independently building infrastructure for the Ethereum
space, or (iv) some combination of all three, possibly with the ratios
somehow being voted on by the token buyers.</p>
<p>Second, you can keep the unsold tokens, but solve the "central
banking" problem by committing to a fully automated plan for how they
would be spent. The reasoning here is similar to that for why many
economists are interested in <a
href="https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/Salter-Monetary-PolicyRules.pdf">rules-based
monetary policy</a>: even if a centralized entity has a large amount of
control over a powerful resource, much of the political uncertainty that
results can be mitigated if the entity credibly commits to following a
set of programmatic rules for how they apply it. For example, the unsold
tokens can be put into a market maker that is tasked with preserving the
tokens' price stability.</p>
<p>Third, you can do a capped sale, where you limit the amount that can
be bought by each person. Doing this effectively requires a KYC process,
but the nice thing is a KYC entity can do this once, whitelisting users'
addresses after they verify that the address represents a unique
individual, and this can then be reused for every token sale, alongside
other applications that can benefit from per-person sybil resistance
like <a href="http://akasha.world">Akasha's</a> <a
href="http://ericposner.com/quadratic-voting/">quadratic voting</a>.
There is still deadweight loss (ie. inefficiency) here, because this
will lead to individuals with no personal interest in tokens
participating in sales because they know they will be able to quickly
flip them on the market for a profit. However, this is arguably not that
bad: it creates a kind of <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoUBI/">crypto universal basic
income</a>, and if behavioral economics assumptions like the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect">endowment
effect</a> are even slightly true it will also succeed at the goal of
ensuring widely distributed ownership.</p>
<h4 id="are-single-round-sales-even-good">Are single round sales even
good?</h4>
<p>Let us get back to the topic of "greed". I would claim that not many
people are, in principle, opposed to the idea of development teams that
are capable of spending $500 million to create a really great project
getting $500 million. Rather, what people are opposed to is (i) the idea
of completely new and untested development teams getting $50 million all
at once, and (ii) even more importantly, the <em>time mismatch between
developers' rewards and token buyers' interests</em>. In a single-round
sale, the developers have only one chance to get money to build the
project, and that is near the start of the development process. There is
no feedback mechanism where teams are first given a small amount of
money to prove themselves, and then given access to more and more
capital over time as they prove themselves to be reliable and
successful. During the sale, there is comparatively little information
to filter between good development teams and bad ones, and once the sale
is completed, the incentive to developers to keep working is relatively
low compared to traditional companies. The "greed" isn't about getting
lots of money, it's about getting lots of money without working hard to
show you're capable of spending it wisely.</p>
<p>If we want to strike at the heart of this problem, how would we solve
it? I would say the answer is simple: start moving to mechanisms other
than single round sales.</p>
<p>I can offer several examples as inspiration:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a
href="https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=1631.0">Angelshares</a></strong>
- this project ran a sale in 2014 where it sold off a fixed percentage
of all AGS every day for a period of several months. During each day,
people could contribute an unlimited amount to the crowdsale, and the
AGS allocation for that day would be split among all contributors.
Basically, this is like having a hundred "micro-rounds" of uncapped
sales over the course of most of a year; I would claim that the duration
of the sales could be stretched even further.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://mysterium.network">Mysterium</a></strong>,
which held a little-noticed <a
href="https://medium.com/mysterium-network/mysterium-network-presale-early-access-5x-reward-b292d423f96">micro-sale</a>
six months before the big one.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://bancor.network">Bancor</a></strong>, which
<a
href="https://blog.bancor.network/the-community-of-the-currency-9770087fde17">recently
agreed</a> to put all funds raised over a cap into a market maker which
will maintain price stability along with maintaining a price floor of
0.01 ETH. These funds cannot be removed from the market maker for two
years.</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems hard to see the relationship between Bancor's strategy and
solving time mismatch incentives, but an element of a solution is there.
To see why, consider two scenarios. As a first case, suppose the sale
raises $30 million, the cap is $10 million, but then after one year
everyone agrees that the project is a flop. In this case, the price
would try to drop below 0.01 ETH, and the market maker would lose all of
its money trying to maintain the price floor, and so the team would only
have $10 million to work with. As a second case, suppose the sale raises
$30 million, the cap is $10 million, and after two years everyone is
happy with the project. In this case, the market maker will not have
been triggered, and the team would have access to the entire $30
million.</p>
<p>A related proposal is Vlad Zamfir's "<a
href="https://medium.com/@Vlad_Zamfir/a-safe-token-sale-mechanism-8d73c430ddd1">safe
token sale mechanism</a>". The concept is a very broad one that could be
parametrized in many ways, but one way to parametrize it is to sell
coins at a price ceiling and then have a price floor slightly below that
ceiling, and then allow the two to diverge over time, freeing up capital
for development over time if the price maintains itself.</p>
<p>Arguably, none of the above three are sufficient; we want sales that
are spread out over an even longer period of time, giving us much more
time to see which development teams are the most worthwhile before
giving them the bulk of their capital. But nevertheless, this seems like
the most productive direction to explore in.</p>
<h4 id="coming-out-of-the-dilemmas">Coming out of the Dilemmas</h4>
<p>From the above, it should hopefully be clear that while there is no
way to counteract the dilemma and trilemma head on, there are ways to
chip away at the edges by thinking outside the box and compromising on
variables that are not apparent from a simplistic view of the problem.
We can compromise on guarantee of participation slightly, mitigating the
impact by using time as a third dimension: if you don't get in during
round <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, you can just wait until
round <span class="math inline">\(N+1\)</span> which will be in a week
and where the price probably will not be that different.</p>
<p>We can have a sale which is uncapped as a whole, but which consists
of a variable number of periods, where the sale within each period is
capped; this way teams would not be asking for very large amounts of
money without proving their ability to handle smaller rounds first. We
can sell small portions of the token supply at a time, removing the
political uncertainty that this entails by putting the remaining supply
into a contract that continues to sell it automatically according to a
prespecified formula.</p>
<p>Here are a few possible mechanisms that follow some of the spirit of
the above ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Host a Gnosis-style reverse dutch auction with a low cap (say, $1
million). If the auction sells less than 100% of the token supply,
automatically put the remaining funds into another auction two months
later with a 30% higher cap. Repeat until the entire token supply is
sold.</li>
<li>Sell an unlimited number of tokens at a price of <span
class="math inline">\(\$X\)</span> and put 90% of the proceeds into a
smart contract that guarantees a price floor of <span
class="math inline">\(\$0.9 \cdot X\)</span>. Have the price ceiling go
up hyperbolically toward infinity, and the price floor go down linearly
toward zero, over a five-year period.</li>
<li>Do the exact same thing AngelShares did, though stretch it out over
5 years instead of a few months.</li>
<li>Host a Gnosis-style reverse dutch auction. If the auction sells less
than 100% of the token supply, put the remaining funds into an automated
market maker that attempts to ensure the token's price stability (note
that if the price continues going up anyway, then the market maker would
be selling tokens, and some of these earnings could be given to the
development team).</li>
<li>Immediately put all tokens into a market maker with
parameters+variables <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> (minimum
price), <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> (fraction of all tokens
already sold), <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> (time since sale
started), <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> (intended duration of
sale, say 5 years), that sells tokens at a price of <span
class="math inline">\(\dfrac{k}{(\frac{t}{T - s})}\)</span> (this one is
weird and may need to be economically studied more).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that there are other mechanisms that should be tried to solve
other problems with token sales; for example, revenues going into a
multisig of curators, which only hand out funds if milestones are being
met, is one very interesting idea that should be done more. However, the
design space is highly multidimensional, and there are a lot more things
that could be tried.</p>
