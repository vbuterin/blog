<title> A Prehistory of the Ethereum Protocol </title>

<p>Although the ideas behind the current Ethereum protocol have largely
been stable for two years, Ethereum did not emerge all at once, in its
current conception and fully formed. Before the blockchain has launched,
the protocol went through a number of significant evolutions and design
decisions. The purpose of this article will be to go through the various
evolutions that the protocol went through from start to launch; the
countless work that was done on the implementations of the protocol such
as Geth, cppethereum, pyethereum, and EthereumJ, as well as the history
of applications and businesses in the Ethereum ecosystem, is
deliberately out of scope.</p>
<p>Also out of scope is the history of Casper and sharding research.
While we can certainly make more blog posts talking about all of the
various ideas Vlad, Gavin, myself and others came up with, and
discarded, including "proof of proof of work", hub-and-spoke chains, "<a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/10/21/scalability-part-2-hypercubes">hypercubes</a>",
<a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/09/17/scalability-part-1-building-top/">shadow
chains</a> (arguably a precursor to <a
href="http://plasma.io/">Plasma</a>), <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Chain-Fibers-Redux">chain
fibers</a>, and <a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/12/06/history-casper-chapter-1/">various
iterations of Casper</a>, as well as Vlad's rapidly evolving thoughts on
reasoning about incentives of actors in consensus protocols and
properties thereof, this would also be far too complex a story to go
through in one post, so we will leave it out for now.</p>
<p>Let us first begin with the very earliest version of what would
eventually become Ethereum, back when it was not even called Ethereum.
When I was visiting Israel in October 2013, I spent quite a bit of time
with the Mastercoin team, and even suggested a few features for them.
After spending a couple of times thinking about what they were doing, I
sent the team a proposal to make their protocol more generalized and
support more types of contracts without adding an equally large and
complex set of features:</p>
<p><a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150627031414/http://vbuterin.com/ultimatescripting.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20150627031414/http://vbuterin.com/ultimatescripting.html</a></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/prehistory-files/ultimatescripting.png"
class="padded" /></p>
<p>Notice that this is very far from the later and more expansive vision
of Ethereum: it specialized purely in what Mastercoin was trying to
specialize in already, namely two-party contracts where parties A and B
would both put in money, and then they would later get money out
according to some formula specified in the contract (eg. a bet would say
"if X happens then give all the money to A, otherwise give all the money
to B"). The scripting language was not Turing-complete.</p>
<p>The Mastercoin team was impressed, but they were not interested in
dropping everything they were doing to go in this direction, which I was
increasingly convinced is the correct choice. So here comes version 2,
circa December:</p>
<p><a
href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/soPo_aa2YSpV8DvGGZbGjAkZehtiqJEa8dPzOM4ZSZxAvZcAfNbnVqErQL1JlG8lcmgpQyXmb3cO9m21asJQKZZmTXGQsLOtvTgBTp_5LOxfdWRZpgh3pys7Os3GK5dFGCL6aIpd">https://web.archive.org/web/20131219030753/http://vitalik.ca/ethereum.html</a></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/prehistory-files/ethereumwhitepaper.png"
class="padded" /></p>
<p>Here you can see the results of a substantial rearchitecting, largely
a result of a long walk through San Francisco I took in November once I
realized that smart contracts could potentially be fully generalized.
Instead of the scripting language being simply a way of describing the
terms of relations between two parties, contracts were themselves
fully-fledged accounts, and had the ability to hold, send and receive
assets, and even maintain a permanent storage (back then, the permanent
storage was called "memory", and the only temporary "memory" was the 256
registers). The language switched from being a stack-based machine to
being a register-based one on my own volition; I had little argument for
this other than that it seemed more sophisticated.</p>
<p>Additionally, notice that there is now a built-in fee mechanism:</p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/prehistory-files/txfee.png"
class="padded" /></p>
<p>At this point, ether literally was gas; after every single
computational step, the balance of the contract that a transaction was
calling would drop a little bit, and if the contract ran out of money
execution would halt. Note that this "receiver pays" mechanism meant
that the contract itself had to require the sender to pay the contract a
fee, and immediately exit if this fee is not present; the protocol
allocated an allowance of 16 free execution steps to allow contracts to
reject non-fee-paying transactions.</p>
<br>
<hr />
<p><br></p>
<p>This was the time when the Ethereum protocol was entirely my own
creation. From here on, however, new participants started to join the
fold. By far the most prominent on the protocol side was Gavin Wood, who
reached out to me in an about.me message in December 2013:</p>
<p><img
src="../../../../images/prehistory-files/gavwoodmessage.png" /></p>
<p>Jeffrey Wilcke, lead developer of the Go client (back then called
"ethereal") also reached out and started coding around the same time,
though his contributions were much more on the side of client
development rather than protocol research.</p>
<p><img
src="../../../../images/prehistory-files/jeffreywilcke.png" /></p>
<center>
<small><i> "Hey Jeremy, glad to see you're interested in Ethereum..."
</i></small>
</center>
<p><br> Gavin's initial contributions were two-fold. First, you might
notice that the contract calling model in the initial design was an
asynchronous one: although contract A could create an "internal
transaction" to contract B ("internal transaction" is Etherscan's lingo;
initially they were just called "transactions" and then later "message
calls" or "calls"), the internal transaction's execution would not start
until the execution of the first transaction completely finished. This
meant that transactions could not use internal transactions as a way of
getting information from other contracts; the only way to do that was
the EXTRO opcode (kind of like an SLOAD that you could use to read other
contracts' storage), and this too was later removed with the support of
Gavin and others.</p>
<p>When implementing my initial spec, Gavin naturally implemented
internal transactions synchronously without even realizing that the
intent was different - that is to say, in Gavin's implementation, when a
contract calls another contract, the internal transaction gets executed
immediately, and once that execution finishes, the VM returns back to
the contract that created the internal transaction and proceeds to the
next opcode. This approach seemed to both of us to be superior, so we
decided to make it part of the spec.</p>
<p>Second, a discussion between him and myself (during a walk in San
Francisco, so the exact details will be forever lost to the winds of
history and possibly a copy or two in the deep archives of the NSA) led
to a re-factoring of the transaction fee model, moving away from the
"contract pays" approach to a "sender pays" approach, and also switching
to the "gas" architecture. Instead of each individual transaction step
immediately taking away a bit of ether, the transaction sender pays for
and is allocated some "gas" (roughly, a counter of computational steps),
and computational steps drew from this allowance of gas. If a
transaction runs out of gas, the gas would still be forfeit, but the
entire execution would be reverted; this seemed like the safest thing to
do, as it removed an entire class of "partial execution" attacks that
contracts previously had to worry about. When a transaction execution
finishes, the fee for any unused gas is refunded.</p>
<p>Gavin can also be largely credited for the subtle change in vision
from viewing Ethereum as a platform for building programmable money,
with blockchain-based contracts that can hold digital assets and
transfer them according to pre-set rules, to a general-purpose computing
platform. This started with subtle changes in emphasis and terminology,
and later this influence became stronger with the increasing emphasis on
the "Web 3" ensemble, which saw Ethereum as being one piece of a suite
of decentralized technologies, the other two being Whisper and
Swarm.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/prehistory-files/web3suite.png" /></p>
<p>There were also changes made around the start of 2014 that were
suggested by others. We ended up moving back to a stack-based
architecture after the idea was suggested by Andrew Miller and
others.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/prehistory-files/amiller1.png" /> <img
src="../../../../images/prehistory-files/amiller2.png" /></p>
<p>Charles Hoskinson suggested the switch from Bitcoin's SHA256 to the
newer SHA3 (or, more accurately, keccak256). Although there was some
controversy for a while, discussions with Gavin, Andrew and others led
to establishing that the size of values on the stack should be limited
to 32 bytes; the other alternative being considered, unlimited-size
integers, had the problem that it was too difficult to figure out how
much gas to charge for additions, multiplications and other
operations.</p>
<br>
<hr />
<p><br></p>
<p>The initial mining algorithm that we had in mind, back in January
2014, was a contraption called Dagger:</p>
<p><a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/blob/master/Dagger.md">https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/blob/master/Dagger.md</a></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/prehistory-files/daggerspec.png" /></p>
<p>Dagger was named after the "directed acyclic graph" (DAG), the
mathematical structure that is used in the algorithm. The idea is that
every N blocks, a new DAG would be pseudorandomly generated from a seed,
and the bottom layer of the DAG would be a collection of nodes that
takes several gigabytes to store. However, generating any individual
value in the DAG would require calculating only a few thousand entries.
A "Dagger computation" involved getting some number of values in random
positions in this bottom-level dataset and hashing them together. This
meant that there was a fast way to make a Dagger calculation - already
having the data in memory, and a slow, but not memory intensive way -
regenerating each value from the DAG that you need to get from
scratch.</p>
<p>The intention of this algorithm was to have the same
"memory-hardness" properties as algorithms that were popular at the
time, like Scrypt, but still be light-client friendly. Miners would use
the fast way, and so their mining would be constrained by memory
bandwidth (the theory is that consumer-grade RAM is already very heavily
optimized, and so it would be hard to further optimize it with ASICs),
but light clients could use the memory-free but slower version for
verification. The fast way might take a few microseconds and the slow
but memory-free way a few milliseconds, so it would still be very viable
for light clients.</p>
<p>From here, the algorithm would change several times over the course
of Ethereum development. The next idea that we went through is "adaptive
proof of work"; here, the proof of work would involve executing randomly
selected Ethereum contracts, and there is a clever reason why this is
expected to be ASIC-resistant: if an ASIC was developed, competing
miners would have the incentive to create and publish many contracts
that that ASIC was not good at executing. There is no such thing as an
ASIC for general computation, the story goes, as that is just a CPU, so
we could instead use this kind of adversarial incentive mechanism to
make a proof of work that essentially was executing general
computation.</p>
<p>This fell apart for one simple reason: <a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/15/long-range-attacks-the-serious-problem-with-adaptive-proof-of-work/">long-range
attacks</a>. An attacker could start a chain from block 1, fill it up
with only simple contracts that they can create specialized hardware
for, and rapidly overtake the main chain. So... back to the drawing
board.</p>
<p>The next algorithm was something called Random Circuit, described in
this google doc <a
href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19c0L7_1neWpTN-jYwW-87mzrTTmS2h3lAYxXpRAvPfo">here</a>,
proposed by myself and Vlad Zamfir, and <a
href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/anonymous/cb53d06b837be97ebe32">analyzed
by Matthew Wampler-Doty</a> and others. The idea here was also to
simulate general-purpose computation inside a mining algorithm, this
time by executing randomly generated circuits. There's no hard proof
that something based on these principles could not work, but the
computer hardware experts that we reached out to in 2014 tended to be
fairly pessimistic on it. Matthew Wampler-Doty himself suggested a proof
of work based on SAT solving, but this too was ultimately rejected.</p>
<p>Finally, we came full circle with an algorithm called "Dagger
Hashimoto". "Dashimoto", as it was sometimes called in short, borrowed
many ideas from <a
href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3b23/7cc60c1b9650e260318d33bec471b8202d5e.pdf">Hashimoto</a>,
a proof of work algorithm by Thaddeus Dryja that pioneered the notion of
"I/O bound proof of work", where the dominant limiting factor in mining
speed was not hashes per second, but rather megabytes per second of RAM
access. However, it combined this with Dagger's notion of
light-client-friendly DAG-generated datasets. After many rounds of
tweaking by myself, Matthew, Tim and others, the ideas finally converged
into the algorithm we now call <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethash">Ethash</a>.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/prehistory-files/hashimoto.png" /></p>
<br>
<hr />
<p><br></p>
<p>By the summer of 2014, the protocol had considerably stabilized, with
the major exception of the proof of work algorithm which would not reach
the Ethash phase until around the beginning of 2015, and a semi-formal
specification existed in the form of Gavin's <a
href="http://gavwood.com/Paper.pdf">yellow paper</a>.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/prehistory-files/yellowpaper.png" /></p>
<p>In August 2014, I developed and introduced <a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/11/toward-a-12-second-block-time/">the
uncle mechanism</a>, which allows Ethereum's blockchain to have a
shorter block time and higher capacity while mitigating centralization
risks. This was introduced as part of PoC6.</p>
<p>Discussions with the Bitshares team led us to consider <a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/08/27/state-ethereum-august-edition/">adding
heaps</a> as a first-class data structure, though we ended up not doing
this due to lack of time, and later security audits and DoS attacks will
show that it is actually much harder than we had thought at the time to
do this safely.</p>
<p>In September, Gavin and I planned out the next two major changes to
the protocol design. First, alongside the state tree and transaction
tree, every block would also contain a "receipt tree". The receipt tree
would include hashes of the logs created by a transaction, along with
intermediate state roots. Logs would allow transactions to create
"outputs" that are saved in the blockchain, and are accessible to light
clients, but that are not accessible to future state calculations. This
could be used to allow decentralized applications to easily query for
events, such as token transfers, purchases, exchange orders being
created and filled, auctions being started, and so forth.</p>
<p>There were other ideas that were considered, like making a Merkle
tree out of the entire execution trace of a transaction to allow
anything to be proven; logs were chosen because they were a compromise
between simplicity and completeness.</p>
<p>The second was the idea of "precompiles", solving the problem of
allowing complex cryptographic computations to be usable in the EVM
without having to deal with EVM overhead. We had also gone through many
more ambitious ideas about "<a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/08/27/state-ethereum-august-edition/">native
contracts</a>", where if miners have an optimized implementation of some
contracts they could "vote" the gasprice of those contracts down, so
contracts that most miners could execute much more quickly would
naturally have a lower gas price; however, all of these ideas were
rejected because we could not come up with a cryptoeconomically safe way
to implement such a thing. An attacker could always create a contract
which executes some trapdoored cryptographic operation, distribute the
trapdoor to themselves and their friends to allow them to execute this
contract much faster, then vote the gasprice down and use this to DoS
the network. Instead we opted for the much less ambitious approach of
having a smaller number of precompiles that are simply specified in the
protocol, for common operations such as hashes and signature
schemes.</p>
<p>Gavin was also a key initial voice in developing the idea of "<a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/07/05/on-abstraction/">protocol
abstraction</a>" - moving as many parts of the protocol such as ether
balances, transaction signing algorithms, nonces, etc into the protocol
itself as contracts, with a theoretical final goal of reaching a
situation where the entire ethereum protocol could be described as
making a function call into a virtual machine that has some
pre-initialized state. There was not enough time for these ideas to get
into the initial Frontier release, but the principles are expected to
start slowly getting integrated through some of the Constantinople
changes, the Casper contract and the sharding specification.</p>
<p>This was all implemented in PoC7; after PoC7, the protocol did not
really change much, with the exception of minor, though in some cases
important, details that would come out through security audits...</p>
<br>
<hr />
<p><br></p>
<p>In early 2015, came the pre-launch security audits organized by Jutta
Steiner and others, which included both software code audits and
academic audits. The software audits were primarily on the C++ and Go
implementations, which were led by Gavin Wood and Jeffrey Wilcke,
respectively, though there was also a smaller audit on my pyethereum
implementation. Of the two academic audits, one was performed by Ittay
Eyal (of "selfish mining" fame), and the other by Andrew Miller and
others from Least Authority. The Eyal audit led to a minor protocol
change: the total difficulty of a chain would not include uncles. The <a
href="https://leastauthority.com/blog/least_authority_performs_incentive_analysis_for_ethereum/">Least
Authority audit</a> was more focused on smart contract and gas
economics, as well as the Patricia tree. This audit led to several
protocol changes. One small one is the use of sha3(addr) and sha3(key)
as trie keys instead of the address and key directly; this would make it
harder to perform a worst-case attack on the trie.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/prehistory-files/leastauthority.png"
class="padded" /></p>
<center>
<small><i>And a warning that was perhaps a bit too far ahead of its
time...</i></small>
</center>
<p><br> Another significant thing that we discussed was the gas limit
voting mechanism. At the time, we were already concerned by perceived
lack of progress in the bitcoin block size debate, and wanted to have a
more flexible design in Ethereum that could adjust over time as needed.
But the challenge is: what is the optimal limit? My initial thought had
been to make a dynamic limit, targeting <span class="math inline">\(1.5
\cdot\)</span> the long-term exponential moving average of the actual
gas usage, so that in the long run on average blocks would be <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{3}\)</span> full. However, Andrew showed
that this was exploitable in some ways - specifically, miners who wanted
to raise the limit would simply include transactions in their own blocks
that consume a very large amount of gas, but take very little time to
process, and thereby always create full blocks at no cost to themselves.
The security model was thus, at least in the upward direction,
equivalent to simply having miners vote on the gas limit.</p>
<p>We did not manage to come up with a gas limit strategy that was less
likely to break, and so Andrew's recommended solution was to simply have
miners vote on the gas limit explicitly, and have the default strategy
for voting be the <span class="math inline">\(1.5\cdot\)</span> EMA
rule. The reasoning was that we were still very far from knowing the
right approach for setting maximum gas limits, and the risk of any
specific approach failing seemed greater than the risk of miners abusing
their voting power. Hence, we might as well simply let miners vote on
the gas limit, and accept the risk that the limit will go too high or
too low, in exchange for the benefit of flexibility, and the ability for
miners to work together to very quickly adjust the limit upwards or
downwards as needed.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>After a mini-hackathon between Gavin, Jeff and myself, PoC9 was
launched in March, and was intended to be the final proof of concept
release. A testnet, Olympic, ran for four months, using the protocol
that was intended to be used in the livenet, and Ethereum's long-term
plan was established. Vinay Gupta wrote a blog post, "<a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/03/ethereum-launch-process/">The
Ethereum Launch Process</a>", that described the four expected stages of
Ethereum livenet development, and gave them their current names:
Frontier, Homestead, Metropolis and Serenity.</p>
<p>Olympic ran for four months. In the first two months, many bugs were
found in the various implementations, consensus failures happened, among
other issues, but around June the network noticeably stabilized. In July
a decision was made to make a code-freeze, followed by a release, and on
July 30 the release took place.</p>
