<title> [Mirror] Central Planning as Overfitting </title>

<p><em>This is a mirror of the post at
https://radicalxchange.org/blog/posts/2018-11-26-4m9b8b/ written by
myself and Glen Weyl</em></p>
<p>There is an intuition shared by many that "central planning" —
command-and-control techniques for allocating resources in economies,
and fine-grained knob-turning interventionism more generally — is
undesirable. There's quite a lot to this, but it is often misapplied in
a way that also leads it to go under-appreciated. In this post we try to
clarify the appropriate scope of the intuition.</p>
<p>Some recent examples of the intuition being misapplied are:</p>
<ul>
<li>People arguing that relatively simple entitlement programs like
Social Security are burdensome government intervention, while elaborate
and often discretionary tax breaks conditional on specific behaviors are
a good step towards less government.</li>
<li>People arguing that block size limits in cryptocurrencies, which
impose a hard cap on the number of transactions that each block can
contain, are a form of central planning, but who do not argue against
other centrally planned parameters, eg. the targeted ten minute (or
whatever) average time interval between blocks.</li>
<li>People arguing that a lack of block size limits <a
href="https://medium.com/@rextar4444/the-block-chain-keynesian-why-pushing-to-scale-bitcoin-to-be-a-coffee-money-is-keynesian-central-c5bdf32a5e4d">constitutes
central planning</a> (!!)</li>
<li>People arguing that <a
href="http://reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/9pck22/the_marvel_of_bulletproofs_is_the_small_tx_size/">fixed
transaction fees constitute central planning</a>, but variable
transaction fees that arise out of an equilibrium itself created by a
fixed block size limit do not.</li>
<li>We were recently at a discussion in policy circles in Washington,
where one of us was arguing for a scheme based on <a
href="https://medium.com/@simondlr/what-is-harberger-tax-where-does-the-blockchain-fit-in-1329046922c6">Harberger
taxes</a> for spectrum licenses, debating against someone defending more
conventional perpetual monopoly licenses on spectrum aggregated at large
levels that would tend to create a few national cellular carriers. The
latter side argued that the Harberger tax scheme constituted
unacceptable bureaucratic interventionism, but seemed to believe that
permanent government-issued monopoly privileges are a property right as
natural as apples falling from a tree.</li>
</ul>
<p>While we do not entirely dismiss this last example, for reasons we
will return to later, it does seem overplayed. Similarly and conversely,
we see many examples where, in the name of defending or promoting
"markets" (or at least "economic rationality") many professional
economists advocate schemes that seem much more to us like central
planning than the systems they seek to replace:</p>
<ul>
<li>The most systematic example of this is the literature on "<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design">optimal mechanism
design</a>," which began with the already extremely complicated and
fragile <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey%E2%80%93Clarke%E2%80%93Groves_mechanism">Vickrey-Clarke-Groves
mechanism</a> and has only gotten more byzantine from there. While
Vickrey's motivation for these ideas was to discover relatively simple
rules that would correct the flaws of standard capitalism, <a
href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr09/cos444/papers/vickrey61.pdf">he
acknowledged</a> in his paper that the design was highly complex in its
direct application and urged future researchers to find simplifications.
Instead of following this counsel, <a
href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/ECTA6995">many
scholars</a> have proposed, for example, schemes that rely on a central
authority being able to specify an infinite dimensional set of prior
beliefs. These schemes, we submit, constitute "central planning" in
precisely the sense we should be concerned with.</li>
<li>Furthermore, these designs are not just matters of theory, but in
practice many applied mechanism designers have created systems with
similar properties. The recent United States Spectrum Incentive auctions
(designed by a few prominent economists and computer scientists)
centralized the enforcement of potential conflicts between transmission
rights using an extremely <a
href="http://www.pnas.org/content/114/28/7202.short">elaborate and
opaque computational engine</a>, rather than allowing conflicts to be
resolved through (for example) common law liability lawsuits as other
interference between property claims and land uses are. A recent design
for the allocation of courses to students at the University of
Pennsylvania designed by a similar team requires students to express
their preferences over courses on a novel numerical scale, allowing them
only narrow language for expressing complementarities and
substitutability between courses and then uses a state-of-the-art
optimization engine to allocate courses. Auction systems designed by
economists and computer scientists at large technology companies, like
Facebook and Google, are even richer and less transparent, and <a
href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/cc219w090xr365i/known%20unknowns%20search%20talk.pptx?dl=0">have
created substantial backlash</a>, inspiring a whole industry of firms
that help advertisers optimize their bidding in elaborate ways against
these systems.</li>
<li>This problem does not merely arise in mechanism design, however. In
the fields of industrial organization (the basis of much antitrust
economics) and the field of macroeconomics (the basis of much monetary
policy), extremely elaborate models with hundreds of parameters are
empirically estimated and used to simulate the effects of mergers or
changes in monetary policy. These models are usually difficult to
explain even to experts in the field, much less democratically-elected
politicians, judges or, god forbid, voters. And yet the confidence we
have in these models, the empirical evidence validating their accuracy,
etc. is almost nothing. Nonetheless, economists consistently promote
such methods as "the state of the art" and they are generally viewed
positively by defenders of the "market economy".</li>
</ul>
<p>To understand why we think the concept of "intervention" is being
misapplied here, we need to understand two different ways of measuring
the extent to which some scheme is "interventionist". The first approach
is to try to measure the absolute magnitude of distortion relative to
some imagined state of nature (anarcho-primitivism, or a blockchain with
no block size limits, or...). However, this approach clearly fails to
capture the intuitions of why central planning is undesirable. For
example, property rights in the physical world are a large intervention
into almost every person's behavior, considerably limiting the actions
that we can take every day. Many of these restrictions are actually of
quite recent historical provenance (beginning with agriculture, and
mostly in the West and not the East or Middle East). However, opponents
of central planning often tend to be the strongest proponents of
property rights!</p>
<p>We can shed some light on this puzzle by looking at another way of
measuring the "central-planny-ness" of some social structure: in short,
measure the number of knobs. Property rights actually score quite well
here: every piece of property is allocated to some person or legal
entity, they can use it as they wish, and no one else can touch it
without their permission. There are choices to make around the edges
(eg. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_possession">adverse
possession rights</a>), but generally there isn't too much room for
changing the scheme around (though note that privatization schemes, ie.
transitions from something other than property rights to property rights
like the auctions we discussed above, have very many knobs, and so there
we can see more risks). Command-and-control regulations with ten
thousand clauses (or market designs that specify elaborate probabilistic
objects, or optimization protocols, etc.), or attempts to <a
href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3737">limit use of
specific features of the blockchain</a> to drive out specific categories
of users, are much less desirable, as such strategies leave many more
choices to central planners. A block size limit and a fixed transaction
fee (or carbon taxes and a cap-and-trade scheme) have the exact same
level of "central-planny-ness" to them: one variable (either quantity or
price) is fixed in the protocol, and the other variable is left to the
market.</p>
<p>Here are some key underlying reasons why we believe that simple
social systems with fewer knobs are so desirable:</p>
<ul>
<li>They have <strong>fewer moving parts that can fail</strong> or
otherwise have unexpected effects.</li>
<li>They are <strong>less likely to overfit</strong>. If a social system
is too complex, there are many parameters to set and relatively few
experiences to draw from when setting the parameters, making it more
likely that the parameters will be set to overfit to one context, and
generalize poorly to other places or to future times. <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/10/13/f-a-hayek-and-the-pretense-of-knowledge"><strong>We
know little</strong></a>, and we should not design systems that demand
us to know a lot.</li>
<li>They are <strong>more resistant to corruption</strong>. If a social
system is simpler, it is more difficult (not impossible, but still more
difficult) to set parameters in ways that encode attempts to privilege
or anti-privilege specific individuals, factions or communities. This is
not only good because it leads to fairness, it is also good because it
leads to less zero-sum conflict.</li>
<li>They can <strong>more easily achieve legitimacy</strong>. Because
simpler systems are easier to understand, and easier for people to
understand that a given implementation is not unfairly privileging
special interests, it is easier to create common knowledge that the
system is fair, creating a stronger sense of trust. Legitimacy is
perhaps the central virtue of social institutions, as it sustains
cooperation and coordination, enables the possibility of democracy (how
can you democratically participate and endorse a system you do not
understand?) and allows for a bottoms-up, rather than top-down, creation
of a such a system, ensuring it can be implemented without much coercion
or violence.</li>
</ul>
<p>These effects are not always achieved (for example, even if a system
has very few knobs, it's often the case that there exists a knob that
can be turned to privilege well-connected and wealthy people as a class
over everyone else), but the simpler a system is, the more likely the
effects are to be achieved.</p>
<p>While avoiding over-complexity and overfit in personal
decision-making is also important, avoiding these issues in large-scale
social systems is even more important, because of the inevitable
possibility of powerful forces attempting to manipulate knobs for the
benefit of special interests, and the need to achieve common knowledge
that the system has not been greatly corrupted, to the point where the
fairness of the system is obvious even to unsophisticated observers.</p>
<p>This is not to condemn all forms or uses of complexity in social
systems. Most science and the inner workings of many technical systems
are likely to be opaque to the public but this does not mean science or
technology is useless in social life; far from it. However, these
systems, to gain legitimacy, usually show that they can reliably achieve
some goal, which is transparent and verifiable. Planes land safely and
on time, computational systems seem to deliver calculations that are
correct, etc. It is by this process of verification, rather than by the
transparency of the system per se, that such systems gain their
legitimacy. However, for many social systems, truly large-scale,
repeatable tests are difficult if not impossible. As such, simplicity is
usually critical to legitimacy.</p>
<h2 id="different-notions-of-simplicity">Different Notions of
Simplicity</h2>
<p>However, there is one class of social systems that seem to be
desirable, and that intellectual advocates of minimizing central
planning tend to agree are desirable, that don't quite fit the simple
"few knobs" characterization that we made above. For example, consider
common law. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law">Common
law</a> is built up over thousands of precedents, and contains a large
number of concepts (eg. see this list under "property law", itself only
a part of common law; have you heard of "quicquid plantatur solo, solo
cedit" before?). However, proponents of private property are very
frequently proponents of common law. So what gives?</p>
<p>Here, we need to make a distinction between redundant complexity, or
many knobs that really all serve a relatively small number of similar
goals, and optimizing complexity, in the extreme one knob per problem
that the system has encountered. In computational complexity theory, we
typically talk about <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity">Kolmogorov
complexity</a>, but there are other notions of complexity that are also
useful here, particularly <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VC_dimension">VC dimension</a> -
roughly, the size of the largest set of situations for which we can turn
the knobs in a particular way to achieve any particular set of outcomes.
Many successful machine learning techniques, such as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine">Support
Vector Machines</a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boosting_(machine_learning)">Boosting</a>,
are quite complex, both in the formal Kolmogorov sense and in terms of
the outcomes they produce, but can be proven to have low VC
dimension.</p>
<p>VC dimension does a nice job capturing some of the arguments for
simplicity mentioned above more explicitly, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>A system with low VC dimension may have some moving parts that fail,
but if it does, its different constituent parts can correct for each
other. By construction, it has built in resilience through
redundancy</li>
<li>Low VC dimension is literally a measure of resistance to
overfit.</li>
<li>Low VC dimension leads to resistance to corruption, because if VC
dimension is low, a corrupt or self-interested party in control of some
knobs will not as easily be able to achieve some particular outcome that
they desire. In particular, this agent will be "checked and balanced" by
other parts of the system that redundantly achieve the originally
desired ends.</li>
<li>They can achieve legitimacy because people can randomly check a few
parts and verify in detail that those parts work in ways that are
reasonable, and assume that the rest of the system works in a similar
way. An example of this was the ratification of the United States
Constitution which, while quite elaborate, was primarily elaborate in
the redundancy with which it applied the principle of checks and
balances of power. Thus most citizens only read one or a few of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers">The
Federalist Papers</a> that explained and defended the Constitution, and
yet got a reasonable sense for what was going on.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not as clean and convenient as a system with low Kolmogorov
complexity, but still much better than a system with high complexity
where the complexity is "optimizing" (for an example of this in the
blockchain context, see <a
href="../../../2017/12/17/voting.html">Vitalik's opposition and
alternative to on-chain governance</a>). The primary disadvantage we see
in Kolmogorov complex but VC simple designs is for new social
institutions, where it may be hard to persuade the public that these are
VC simple. VC simplicity is usually easier as a basis for legitimacy
when an institutions has clearly been built up without any clear design
over a long period of time or by a large committee of people with
conflicting interests (as with the United States Constitution). Thus
when offering innovations we tend to focus more on Kolmogorov simplicity
and hope many redundant each Kolmogorov-simple elements will add up to a
VC-simple system. However, we may just not have the imagination to think
of how VC simplicity might be effectively explained.</p>
<p>There are forms of the "avoid central planning" intuition that are
misunderstandings and ultimately counterproductive. For example, try to
automatically seize upon designs that seem at first glance to "look like
a market", because not all markets are created equal. For example, one
of us has argued for using <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/first-and-second-price-auctions-and-improved-transaction-fee-markets/2410">fixed
prices in certain settings to reduce uncertainty</a>, and the other has
(for similar information sharing reasons) argued for auctions that are a
synthesis of standard descending price Dutch and ascending price English
auctions (Channel auctions). That said, it is also equally a large error
to throw the intuition away entirely. Rather, it is a valuable and
important insight that can easily is central to the methodology we have
been recently trying to develop. Simplicity to Whom? Or Why Humanities
Matter</p>
<p>However, the academic critics of this type of work are not simply
confused. There is a reasonable basis for unease with discussions of
"simplicity" because they inevitably contain a degree of subjectivity.
What is "simple" to describe or appears to have few knobs in one
language for describing it is devilishly complex in another, and vice
versa. A few examples should help illuminate the point:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have repeatedly referred to "knobs", which are roughly real
valued parameters. But real-valued parameters can encode an arbitrary
amount of complexity. For example, I could claim my system has only one
knob, it is just that slight changes in the 1000th decimal place of the
setting of that knob end up determining incredibly important properties
of the system. This may seem cheap, but more broadly it is the case that
non-linear mappings between systems can make one system seem "simple"
and another "complex" and in general there is just no way to say which
is right.</li>
<li>Many think of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_the_United_States#Levels_of_election">electoral
system of the United States</a> as "simple", and yet, if one reflects on
it or tries to explain it to a foreigner, it is almost impossible to
describe. It is familiar, not simple, and we just have given a label to
it ("the American system") that lets us refer to it in a few words.
Systems like Quadratic Voting, or <a
href="https://ballotpedia.org/Ranked-choice_voting_(RCV)">ranked choice
voting</a>, are often described as complex, but this seems to have more
to do with lack of familiarity than complexity.</li>
<li>Many scientific concepts, such as the "light cone", are the simplest
thing possible once one understands special relativity and yet are
utterly foreign and bizarre without having wrapped one's hands around
this theory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity">Kolmogorov
complexity</a> (length of the shortest computer program that encodes
some given system) is relative to some programming language. Now, to
some extent, VC dimension offers a solution: it says that a class of
systems is simple if it is not too flexible. But consider what happens
when you try to apply this; to do so, let's return to our example
upfront about Harberger taxes v. perpetual licenses for spectrum.</p>
<p>Harberger taxes strike us as quite simple: there is a single tax rate
(and the theory even says this is tied down by the rate at which assets
turnover, at least if we want to maximally favor allocative efficiency)
and the system can be described in a sentence or two. It seems pretty
clear that such a system could not be contorted to achieve arbitrary
ends. However, an opponent could claim that we chose the Harberger tax
from an array of millions of possible mechanisms of a similar class to
achieve a specific objective, and it just sounds simple (as with our
examples of "deceptive" simplicity above).</p>
<p>To counter this argument, we would respond that the Harberger tax, or
very similar ideas, have been repeatedly discovered or used (to some
success) throughout human history, <a
href="https://theweek.com/articles/703720/genius-way-ancient-greeks-taxed-citizens">beginning
with the Greeks</a>, and that we do not propose this system simply for
spectrum licenses but in a wide range of contexts. The chances that in
all these contexts we are cherry-picking the system to "fit" that
setting seems low. We would submit to the critic to judge whether it is
really plausible that all these historical circumstances and these wide
range of applications just "happen" to coincide.</p>
<p>Focusing on familiarity (ie. conservatism), rather than simplicity in
some abstract mathematical sense, also carries many of the benefits of
simplicity as we described above; after all, familiarity is simplicity,
if the language we are using to describe ideas includes references to
our shared historical experience. Familiar mechanisms also have the
benefit that we have more knowledge of how similar ideas historically
worked in practice. So why not just be conservative, and favor perpetual
property licenses strongly over Harberger taxes?</p>
<p>There are three flaws in that logic, it seems to us. First, to the
extent it is applied, it should be applied uniformly to all innovation,
not merely to new social institutions. Technologies like the internet
have contributed greatly to human progress, but have also led to
significant social upheavals; this is not a reason to stop trying to
advance our technologies and systems for communication, and it is not a
reason to stop trying to advance our social technologies for allocating
scarce resources.</p>
<p>Second, the benefits of innovation are real, and social institutions
stand to benefit from growing human intellectual progress as much as
everything else. The theoretical case for Harberger taxes providing
efficiency benefits is strong, and there is great social value in doing
small and medium-scale experiments to try ideas like them out. Investing
in experiments today increases what we know, and so increases the scope
of what can be done "conservatively" tomorrow.</p>
<p>Third, and most importantly, the cultural context in which you as a
decision maker have grown up today is far from the only culture that has
existed on earth. Even at present, Singapore, China, Taiwan and
Scandinavia have had significant success with quite different property
regimes than the United States. Video game developers and internet
protocol designers have had to solve incentive problems of a similar
character to what we see today in the blockchain space and have come up
with many kinds of solutions, and throughout history, we have seen a
wide variety of social systems used for different purposes, with a wide
range of resulting outcomes. By learning about the different ways in
which societies have lived, understood what is natural and imagined
their politics, we can gain the benefits of learning from historical
experience and yet at the same time open ourselves to a much broader
space of possible ideas to work with.</p>
<p>This is why we believe that balance and collaboration between
different modes of learning and understanding, both the mathematical one
of economists and computer scientists, and the historical experiences
studied by historians, anthropologists, political scientists, etc is
critical to avoid the mix of and often veering between extreme
conservatism and dangerous utopianism that has become characteristic of
much intellectual discourse in e.g. the economics community, the
"rationalist" community, and in <a
href="http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/against-the-hard-fork/">many</a> <a
href="../../../2018/03/28/plutocracy.html">cases</a> blockchain protocol
design.</p>
