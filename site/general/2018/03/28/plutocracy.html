<title> Governance, Part 2: Plutocracy Is Still Bad </title>

<p>Coin holder voting, both for governance of technical features, and
for more extensive use cases like deciding who runs validator nodes and
who receives money from development bounty funds, is unfortunately
continuing to be popular, and so it seems worthwhile for me to write
another post explaining why I (and <a
href="https://medium.com/@Vlad_Zamfir/against-on-chain-governance-a4ceacd040ca">Vlad
Zamfir</a> and others) do not consider it wise for Ethereum (or really,
any base-layer blockchain) to start adopting these kinds of mechanisms
in a tightly coupled form in any significant way.</p>
<p>I wrote about the issues with tightly coupled voting <a
href="../../../2017/12/17/voting.html">in a blog post</a> last year,
that focused on theoretical issues as well as focusing on some practical
issues experienced by voting systems over the previous two years. Now,
the latest scandal in DPOS land seems to be substantially worse. Because
the delegate rewards in EOS are now so high (5% annual inflation, about
$400m per year), the competition on who gets to run nodes has
essentially become yet another frontier of US-China geopolitical
economic warfare.</p>

</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>And that's not my own interpretation; I quote from <a
href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/34902188">this article (original in
Chinese)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>EOS supernode voting: multibillion-dollar profits leading to
crypto community inter-country warfare</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Looking at community recognition, Chinese nodes feel much less
represented in the community than US and Korea. Since the EOS.IO
official Twitter account was founded, there has never been any
interaction with the mainland Chinese EOS community. For a listing of
the EOS officially promoted events and interactions with communities see
the picture below.</p>

</center>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>With no support from the developer community, facing competition from
Korea, the Chinese EOS supernodes have invented a new strategy: buying
votes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article then continues to describe further strategies, like
forming "alliances" that all vote (or buy votes) for each other.</p>
<p>Of course, it does not matter at all who the specific actors are that
are buying votes or forming cartels; this time it's some Chinese pools,
<a href="https://liskgdt.net/">last time</a> it was "members located in
the USA, Russia, India, Germany, Canada, Italy, Portugal and many other
countries from around the globe", next time it could be totally
anonymous, or run out of a smartphone snuck into Trendon Shavers's
prison cell. What matters is that blockchains and cryptocurrency,
originally founded in a vision of using technology to escape from the
failures of human politics, have essentially all but replicated it.
Crypto is a reflection of the world at large.</p>
<p>The EOS New York community's response seems to be that they have
issued a strongly worded letter to the world stating that <a
href="https://steemit.com/eos/@eosnewyork/block-one-confirms-vote-buying-will-be-against-eos-io-proposed-constitution">buying
votes will be against the constitution</a>. Hmm, what other major
political entity has <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoluments_Clause">made accepting
bribes a violation of the constitution</a>? And how has that been going
for them lately?</p>
<br>
<hr />
<p><br></p>
<p>The second part of this article will involve me, an armchair
economist, hopefully convincing you, the reader, that yes, bribery is,
in fact, bad. There are actually people who dispute this claim; the
usual argument has something to do with market efficiency, as in "isn't
this good, because it means that the nodes that win will be the nodes
that can be the cheapest, taking the least money for themselves and
their expenses and giving the rest back to the community?" The answer
is, kinda yes, but in a way that's centralizing and vulnerable to
rent-seeking cartels and explicitly contradicts many of the explicit
promises made by most DPOS proponents along the way.</p>
<p>Let us create a toy economic model as follows. There are a number of
people all of which are running to be delegates. The delegate slot gives
a reward of $100 per period, and candidates promise to share some
portion of that as a bribe, equally split among all of their voters. The
actual <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> delegates (eg. <span
class="math inline">\(N = 35\)</span>) in any period are the <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> delegates that received the most votes;
that is, during every period a threshold of votes emerges where if you
get more votes than that threshold you are a delegate, if you get less
you are not, and the threshold is set so that <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> delegates are above the threshold.</p>
<p>We expect that voters vote for the candidate that gives them the
highest expected bribe. Suppose that all candidates start off by sharing
1%; that is, equally splitting $1 among all of their voters. Then, if
some candidate becomes a delegate with <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span> voters, each voter gets a payment of
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{K}\)</span>. The candidate that
it's most profitable to vote for is a candidate that's expected to be in
the top <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, but is expected to earn
the fewest votes within that set. Thus, we expect votes to be fairly
evenly split among 35 delegates.</p>
<p>Now, some candidates will want to secure their position by sharing
more; by sharing 2%, you are likely to get twice as many votes as those
that share 1%, as that's the equilibrium point where voting for you has
the same payout as voting for anyone else. The extra guarantee of being
elected that this gives is definitely worth losing an additional 1% of
your revenue when you do get elected. We can expect delegates to bid up
their bribes and eventually share something close to 100% of their
revenue. So the outcome seems to be that the delegate payouts are
largely simply returned to voters, making the delegate payout mechanism
close to meaningless.</p>
<p>But it gets worse. At this point, there's an incentive for delegates
to form alliances (aka political parties, aka cartels) to coordinate
their share percentages; this reduces losses to the cartel from chaotic
competition that accidentally leads to some delegates not getting enough
votes. Once a cartel is in place, it can start bringing its share
percentages down, as dislodging it is a hard coordination problem: if a
cartel offers 80%, then a new entrant offers 90%, then to a voter,
seeking a share of that extra 10% is not worth the risk of either (i)
voting for someone who gets insufficient votes and does not pay rewards,
or (ii) voting for someone who gets too many votes and so pays out a
reward that's excessively diluted.</p>

<p><small><i>Sidenote:
<a href="https://bitshares.org/technology/delegated-proof-of-stake-consensus/">Bitshares
DPOS</a> used approval voting, where you can vote for as many candidates
as you want; it should be pretty obvious that with even slight bribery,
the equilibrium there is that everyone just votes for
everyone.</i></small></p>
<p>Furthermore, even if cartel mechanics <em>don't</em> come into play,
there is a further issue. This equilibrium of coin holders voting for
whoever gives them the most bribes, or a cartel that has become an
entrenched rent seeker, contradicts explicit promises made by DPOS
proponents.</p>
<p>Quoting "<a
href="https://hackernoon.com/explain-delegated-proof-of-stake-like-im-5-888b2a74897d">Explain
Delegated Proof of Stake Like I'm 5</a>":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a Witness starts acting like an asshole, or stops doing a quality
job securing the network, people in the community can remove their
votes, essentially firing the bad actor. Voting is always ongoing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From "<a href="https://eos.io/documents/EOS_An_Introduction.pdf">EOS:
An Introduction</a>":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By custom, we suggest that the bulk of the value be returned to the
community for the common good - software improvements, dispute
resolution, and the like can be entertained. In the spirit of "eating
our own dogfood," the design envisages that the community votes on a set
of open entry contracts that act like "foundations" for the benefit of
the community. Known as Community Benefit Contracts, the mechanism
highlights the importance of DPOS as enabling direct on-chain governance
by the community (below).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The flaw in all of this, of course, is that the average voter has
only a very small chance of impacting which delegates get selected, and
so they only have a very small incentive to vote based on any of these
high-minded and lofty goals; rather, their incentive is to vote for
whoever offers the highest and most reliable bribe. Attacking is easy.
If a cartel equilibrium does not form, then an attacker can simply offer
a share percentage slightly higher than 100% (perhaps using fee sharing
or some kind of "starter promotion" as justification), capture the
majority of delegate positions, and then start an attack. If they get
removed from the delegate position via a hard fork, they can simply
restart the attack again with a different identity.</p>
<br>
<hr />
<p><br></p>
<p>The above is not intended purely as a criticism of DPOS consensus or
its use in any specific blockchain. Rather, the critique reaches much
further. There has been a large number of projects recently that extol
the virtues of extensive on-chain governance, where on-chain coin holder
voting can be used not just to vote on protocol features, but also to
control a bounty fund. Quoting a <a
href="https://medium.com/@FEhrsam/blockchain-governance-programming-our-future-c3bfe30f2d74">blog
post from last year</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyone can submit a change to the governance structure in the form of
a code update. An on-chain vote occurs, and if passed, the update makes
its way on to a test network. After a period of time on the test
network, a confirmation vote occurs, at which point the change goes live
on the main network. They call this concept a "self-amending ledger".
Such a system is interesting because it shifts power towards users and
away from the more centralized group of developers and miners. On the
developer side, anyone can submit a change, and most importantly,
everyone has an economic incentive to do it. Contributions are rewarded
by the community with newly minted tokens through inflation funding.
This shifts from the current Bitcoin and Ethereum dynamics where a new
developer has little incentive to evolve the protocol, thus power tends
to concentrate amongst the existing developers, to one where everyone
has equal earning power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In practice, of course, what this can easily lead to is funds that
offer kickbacks to users who vote for them, leading to the exact
scenario that we saw above with DPOS delegates. In the best case, the
funds will simply be returned to voters, giving coin holders an interest
rate that cancels out the inflation, and in the worst case, some portion
of the inflation will get captured as economic rent by a cartel.</p>
<p>Note also that the above is not a criticism of <em>all</em> on-chain
voting; it does not rule out systems like futarchy. However, futarchy is
untested, but coin voting <em>is</em> tested, and so far it seems to
lead to a high risk of economic or political failure of some kind - far
too high a risk for a platform that seeks to be an economic base layer
for development of decentralized applications and institutions.</p>

<hr />
<p><br></p>
<p>So what's the alternative? The answer is what we've been saying all
along: <em>cryptoeconomics</em>. <a
href="https://www.coindesk.com/making-sense-cryptoeconomics/">Cryptoeconomics</a>
is fundamentally about the use of economic incentives together with
cryptography to design and secure different kinds of systems and
applications, including consensus protocols. The goal is simple: to be
able to measure the security of a system (that is, the cost of breaking
the system or causing it to violate certain guarantees) in dollars.
Traditionally, the security of systems often depends on <em>social</em>
trust assumptions: the system works if 2 of 3 of Alice, Bob and Charlie
are honest, and we trust Alice, Bob and Charlie to be honest because I
know Alice and she's a nice girl, Bob registered with FINCEN and has a
money transmitter license, and Charlie has run a successful business for
three years and wears a suit.</p>
<p>Social trust assumptions can work well in many contexts, but they are
difficult to universalize; what is trusted in one country or one company
or one political tribe may not be trusted in others. They are also
difficult to quantify; how much money does it take to manipulate social
media to favor some particular delegate in a vote? Social trust
assumptions seem secure and controllable, in the sense that "people" are
in charge, but in reality they can be manipulated by economic incentives
in all sorts of ways.</p>
<p>Cryptoeconomics is about trying to reduce social trust assumptions by
creating systems where we introduce explicit economic incentives for
good behavior and economic penalties for bad behavior, and making
mathematical proofs of the form "in order for guarantee <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to be violated, at least these people
need to misbehave in this way, which means the minimum amount of
penalties or foregone revenue that the participants suffer is <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>". <a
href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09437">Casper</a> <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/cbc-casper/wiki">is</a> <a
href="https://medium.com/@jonchoi/ethereum-casper-101-7a851a4f1eb0">designed</a>
to accomplish precisely this objective in the context of proof of stake
consensus. Yes, this does mean that you can't create a "blockchain" by
concentrating the consensus validation into 20 uber-powerful
"supernodes" and you have to <a
href="https://medium.com/@icebearhww/ethereum-sharding-workshop-in-taipei-a44c0db8b8d9">actually
think</a> to make a design that intelligently breaks through and
navigates existing tradeoffs and achieves massive scalability in a
still-decentralized network. But the reward is that you don't get a
network that's constantly liable to breaking in half or becoming
economically captured by unpredictable political forces.</p>

<small><i>It has been brought to my attention that EOS may be reducing
its delegate rewards from 5% per year to 1% per year. Needless to say,
this doesn't really change the fundamental validity of any of the
arguments; the only result of this would be 5x less rent extraction
potential at the cost of a 5x reduction to the cost of attacking the
system.</i></small>
</li>
<li>
<small><i>Some have asked: but how can it be wrong for DPOS delegates to
bribe voters, when it is perfectly legitimate for mining and stake pools
to give 99% of their revenues back to their participants? The answer
should be clear: in PoW and PoS, it's the protocol's role to determine
the rewards that miners and validators get, based on the miners and
validators' observed performance, and the fact that miners and
validators that are pools pass along the rewards (and penalties!) to
their participants gives the participants an incentive to participate in
good pools. In DPOS, the reward is constant, and it's the voters' role
to vote for pools that have good performance, but with the key flaw that
there is no mechanism to actually encourage voters to vote in that way
instead of just voting for whoever gives them the most money without
taking performance into account. Penalties in DPOS do not exist, and are
certainly not passed on to voters, so voters have no "skin in the game"
(penalties in Casper pools, on the other hand, <b>do</b> get passed on
to participants).</i></small>
