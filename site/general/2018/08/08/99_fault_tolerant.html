<p><em>Special thanks to Emin Gun Sirer for review</em></p>
<p>We've heard for a long time that it's possible to achieve consensus with 50% fault tolerance in a synchronous network where messages broadcasted by any honest node are guaranteed to be received by all other honest nodes within some known time period (if an attacker has <em>more</em> than 50%, they can perform a "51% attack", and there's an analogue of this for any algorithm of this type). We've also heard for a long time that if you want to relax the synchrony assumption, and have an algorithm that's "safe under asynchrony", the maximum achievable fault tolerance drops to 33% (<a href="http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf">PBFT</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09437">Casper FFG</a>, etc all fall into this category). But did you know that if you add <em>even more</em> assumptions (specifically, you require <em>observers</em>, ie. users that are not actively participating in the consensus but care about its output, to also be actively watching the consensus, and not just downloading its output after the fact), you can increase fault tolerance all the way to 99%?</p>
<p>This has in fact been known for a long time; Leslie Lamport's famous 1982 paper "The Byzantine Generals Problem" (link <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~luca/cs174/byzantine.pdf">here</a>) contains a description of the algorithm. The following will be my attempt to describe and reformulate the algorithm in a simplified form.</p>
<p>Suppose that there are <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> consensus-participating nodes, and everyone agrees who these nodes are ahead of time (depending on context, they could have been selected by a trusted party or, if stronger decentralization is desired, by some proof of work or proof of stake scheme). We label these nodes <span class="math inline">\(0 ...N-1\)</span>. Suppose also that there is a known bound <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> on network latency plus clock disparity (eg. <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> = 8 seconds). Each node has the ability to publish a value at time <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> (a malicious node can of course propose values earlier or later than <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>). All nodes wait <span class="math inline">\((N-1) \cdot D\)</span> seconds, running the following process. Define <span class="math inline">\(x : i\)</span> as "the value <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> signed by node <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>", <span class="math inline">\(x : i : j\)</span> as "the value <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> signed by <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, and that value and signature together signed by <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>", etc. The proposals published in the first stage will be of the form <span class="math inline">\(v: i\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, containing the signature of the node that proposed it.</p>
<p>If a validator <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> receives some message <span class="math inline">\(v : i[1] : ... : i[k]\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(i[1] ... i[k]\)</span> is a list of indices that have (sequentially) signed the message already (just <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> by itself would count as <span class="math inline">\(k=0\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(v:i\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(k=1\)</span>), then the validator checks that (i) the time is less than <span class="math inline">\(T + k \cdot D\)</span>, and (ii) they have not yet seen a valid message containing <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>; if both checks pass, they publish <span class="math inline">\(v : i[1] : ... : i[k] : i\)</span>.</p>
<p>At time <span class="math inline">\(T + (N-1) \cdot D\)</span>, nodes stop listening. At this point, there is a guarantee that honest nodes have all "validly seen" the same set of values.</p>
<center>
<img src="/images/99-fault-tolerant-files/Lamport.png" /><br> <i><small>Node 1 (red) is malicious, and nodes 0 and 2 (grey) are honest. At the start, the two honest nodes make their proposals <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, and the attacker proposes both <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> late. <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> reaches node 0 on time but not node 2, and <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> reaches neither node on time. At time <span class="math inline">\(T + D\)</span>, nodes 0 and 2 rebroadcast all values they've seen that they have not yet broadcasted, but add their signatures on (<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> for node 0, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> for node 2). Both honest nodes saw <span class="math inline">\({x, y, w}\)</span>.</small></i>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>If the problem demands choosing one value, they can use some "choice" function to pick a single value out of the values they have seen (eg. they take the one with the lowest hash). The nodes can then agree on this value.</p>
<p>Now, let's explore why this works. What we need to prove is that if one honest node has seen a particular value (validly), then every other honest node has also seen that value (and if we prove this, then we know that all honest nodes have seen the same set of values, and so if all honest nodes are running the same choice function, they will choose the same value). Suppose that any honest node receives a message <span class="math inline">\(v : i[1] : ... : i[k]\)</span> that they perceive to be valid (ie. it arrives before time <span class="math inline">\(T + k \cdot D\)</span>). Suppose <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is the index of a single other honest node. Either <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is part of <span class="math inline">\({i[1] ... i[k]}\)</span> or it is not.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the first case (say <span class="math inline">\(x = i[j]\)</span> for this message), we know that the honest node <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> had already broadcasted that message, and they did so in response to a message with <span class="math inline">\(j-1\)</span> signatures that they received before time <span class="math inline">\(T + (j-1) \cdot D\)</span>, so they broadcast their message at that time, and so the message must have been received by all honest nodes before time <span class="math inline">\(T + j \cdot D\)</span>.</li>
<li>In the second case, since the honest node sees the message before time <span class="math inline">\(T + k \cdot D\)</span>, then they will broadcast the message with their signature and guarantee that everyone, including <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, will see it before time <span class="math inline">\(T + (k+1) \cdot D\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that the algorithm uses the act of adding one's own signature as a kind of "bump" on the timeout of a message, and it's this ability that guarantees that if one honest node saw a message on time, they can ensure that everyone else sees the message on time as well, as the definition of "on time" increments by more than network latency with every added signature.</p>
<p>In the case where one node is honest, can we guarantee that passive <em>observers</em> (ie. non-consensus-participating nodes that care about knowing the outcome) can also see the outcome, even if we require them to be watching the process the whole time? With the scheme as written, there's a problem. Suppose that a commander and some subset of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> (malicious) validators produce a message <span class="math inline">\(v : i[1] : .... : i[k]\)</span>, and broadcast it directly to some "victims" just before time <span class="math inline">\(T + k \cdot D\)</span>. The victims see the message as being "on time", but when they rebroadcast it, it only reaches all honest consensus-participating nodes after <span class="math inline">\(T + k \cdot D\)</span>, and so all honest consensus-participating nodes reject it.</p>

</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>But we can plug this hole. We require <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> to be a bound on <em>two times</em> network latency plus clock disparity. We then put a different timeout on observers: an observer accepts <span class="math inline">\(v : i[1] : .... : i[k]\)</span> before time <span class="math inline">\(T + (k - 0.5) \cdot D\)</span>. Now, suppose an observer sees a message an accepts it. They will be able to broadcast it to an honest node before time <span class="math inline">\(T + k \cdot D\)</span>, and the honest node will issue the message with their signature attached, which will reach all other observers before time <span class="math inline">\(T + (k + 0.5) \cdot D\)</span>, the timeout for messages with <span class="math inline">\(k+1\)</span> signatures.</p>

<h3 id="retrofitting-onto-other-consensus-algorithms">Retrofitting onto other consensus algorithms</h3>
<p>The above could theoretically be used as a standalone consensus algorithm, and could even be used to run a proof-of-stake blockchain. The validator set of round <span class="math inline">\(N+1\)</span> of the consensus could itself be decided during round <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> of the consensus (eg. each round of a consensus could also accept "deposit" and "withdraw" transactions, which if accepted and correctly signed would add or remove validators into the next round). The main additional ingredient that would need to be added is a mechanism for deciding who is allowed to propose blocks (eg. each round could have one designated proposer). It could also be modified to be usable as a proof-of-work blockchain, by allowing consensus-participating nodes to "declare themselves" in real time by publishing a proof of work solution on top of their public key at th same time as signing a message with it.</p>
<p>However, the synchrony assumption is very strong, and so we would like to be able to work without it in the case where we don't need more than 33% or 50% fault tolerance. There is a way to accomplish this. Suppose that we have some other consensus algorithm (eg. PBFT, Casper FFG, chain-based PoS) whose output <em>can</em> be seen by occasionally-online observers (we'll call this the <em>threshold-dependent</em> consensus algorithm, as opposed to the algorithm above, which we'll call the <em>latency-dependent</em> consensus algorithm). Suppose that the threshold-dependent consensus algorithm runs continuously, in a mode where it is constantly "finalizing" new blocks onto a chain (ie. each finalized value points to some previous finalized value as a "parent"; if there's a sequence of pointers <span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow ... \rightarrow B\)</span>, we'll call <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> a <em>descendant</em> of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>).</p>
<p>We can retrofit the latency-dependent algorithm onto this structure, giving always-online observers access to a kind of "strong finality" on checkpoints, with fault tolerance ~95% (you can push this arbitrarily close to 100% by adding more validators and requiring the process to take longer).</p>
<p>Every time the time reaches some multiple of 4096 seconds, we run the latency-dependent algorithm, choosing 512 random nodes to participate in the algorithm. A valid proposal is any valid chain of values that were finalized by the threshold-dependent algorithm. If a node sees some finalized value before time <span class="math inline">\(T + k \cdot D\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> = 8 seconds) with <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> signatures, it accepts the chain into its set of known chains and rebroadcasts it with its own signature added; observers use a threshold of <span class="math inline">\(T + (k - 0.5) \cdot D\)</span> as before.</p>
<p>The "choice" function used at the end is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finalized values that are not descendants of what was already agreed to be a finalized value in the previous round are ignored</li>
<li>Finalized values that are invalid are ignored</li>
<li>To choose between two valid finalized values, pick the one with the lower hash</li>
</ul>
<p>If 5% of validators are honest, there is only a roughly 1 in 1 trillion chance that none of the 512 randomly selected nodes will be honest, and so as long as the network latency plus clock disparity is less than <span class="math inline">\(\frac{D}{2}\)</span> the above algorithm will work, correctly coordinating nodes on some single finalized value, even if multiple conflicting finalized values are presented because the fault tolerance of the threshold-dependent algorithm is broken.</p>
<p>If the fault tolerance of the threshold-dependent consensus algorithm is met (usually 50% or 67% honest), then the threshold-dependent consensus algorithm will either not finalize any new checkpoints, or it will finalize new checkpoints that are compatible with each other (eg. a series of checkpoints where each points to the previous as a parent), so even if network latency exceeds <span class="math inline">\(\frac{D}{2}\)</span> (or even <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>), and as a result nodes participating in the latency-dependent algorithm disagree on which value they accept, the values they accept are still guaranteed to be part of the same chain and so there is no actual disagreement. Once latency recovers back to normal in some future round, the latency-dependent consensus will get back "in sync".</p>
<p>If the assumptions of both the threshold-dependent and latency-dependent consensus algorithms are broken <em>at the same time</em> (or in consecutive rounds), then the algorithm can break down. For example, suppose in one round, the threshold-dependent consensus finalizes <span class="math inline">\(Z \rightarrow Y \rightarrow X\)</span> and the latency-dependent consensus disagrees between <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, and in the next round the threshold-dependent consensus finalizes a descendant <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> which is <em>not</em> a descendant of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>; in the latency-dependent consensus, the nodes who agreed <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> will not accept <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>, but the nodes that agreed <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> will. However, this is unavoidable; the impossibility of safe-under-asynchrony consensus with more than <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{3}\)</span> fault tolerance is a <a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/jacm88.pdf">well known result</a> in Byzantine fault tolerance theory, as is the impossibility of more than <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> fault tolerance even allowing synchrony assumptions but assuming offline observers.</p>
