<title> A Guide to 99% Fault Tolerant Consensus </title>

<p><em>Special thanks to Emin Gun Sirer for review</em></p>
<p>We've heard for a long time that it's possible to achieve consensus
with 50% fault tolerance in a synchronous network where messages
broadcasted by any honest node are guaranteed to be received by all
other honest nodes within some known time period (if an attacker has
<em>more</em> than 50%, they can perform a "51% attack", and there's an
analogue of this for any algorithm of this type). We've also heard for a
long time that if you want to relax the synchrony assumption, and have
an algorithm that's "safe under asynchrony", the maximum achievable
fault tolerance drops to 33% (<a
href="http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf">PBFT</a>, <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09437">Casper FFG</a>, etc all fall
into this category). But did you know that if you add <em>even more</em>
assumptions (specifically, you require <em>observers</em>, ie. users
that are not actively participating in the consensus but care about its
output, to also be actively watching the consensus, and not just
downloading its output after the fact), you can increase fault tolerance
all the way to 99%?</p>
<p>This has in fact been known for a long time; Leslie Lamport's famous
1982 paper "The Byzantine Generals Problem" (link <a
href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~luca/cs174/byzantine.pdf">here</a>)
contains a description of the algorithm. The following will be my
attempt to describe and reformulate the algorithm in a simplified
form.</p>
<p>Suppose that there are <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>
consensus-participating nodes, and everyone agrees who these nodes are
ahead of time (depending on context, they could have been selected by a
trusted party or, if stronger decentralization is desired, by some proof
of work or proof of stake scheme). We label these nodes <span
class="math inline">\(0 ...N-1\)</span>. Suppose also that there is a
known bound <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> on network latency
plus clock disparity (eg. <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> = 8
seconds). Each node has the ability to publish a value at time <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> (a malicious node can of course propose
values earlier or later than <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>).
All nodes wait <span class="math inline">\((N-1) \cdot D\)</span>
seconds, running the following process. Define <span
class="math inline">\(x : i\)</span> as "the value <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> signed by node <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span>", <span class="math inline">\(x : i :
j\)</span> as "the value <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> signed
by <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, and that value and signature
together signed by <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>", etc. The
proposals published in the first stage will be of the form <span
class="math inline">\(v: i\)</span> for some <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, containing the signature of the node
that proposed it.</p>
<p>If a validator <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> receives some
message <span class="math inline">\(v : i[1] : ... : i[k]\)</span>,
where <span class="math inline">\(i[1] ... i[k]\)</span> is a list of
indices that have (sequentially) signed the message already (just <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> by itself would count as <span
class="math inline">\(k=0\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(v:i\)</span> as <span
class="math inline">\(k=1\)</span>), then the validator checks that (i)
the time is less than <span class="math inline">\(T + k \cdot
D\)</span>, and (ii) they have not yet seen a valid message containing
<span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>; if both checks pass, they
publish <span class="math inline">\(v : i[1] : ... : i[k] :
i\)</span>.</p>
<p>At time <span class="math inline">\(T + (N-1) \cdot D\)</span>, nodes
stop listening. At this point, there is a guarantee that honest nodes
have all "validly seen" the same set of values.</p>
<center>
<img src="../../../..../../../../images/99-fault-tolerant-files/Lamport.png" class="padded" /><br><br>
<i><small>Node 1 (red) is malicious, and nodes 0 and 2 (grey) are
honest. At the start, the two honest nodes make their proposals <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, and the attacker proposes both <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> late. <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> reaches node 0 on time but not node 2,
and <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> reaches neither node on time.
At time <span class="math inline">\(T + D\)</span>, nodes 0 and 2
rebroadcast all values they've seen that they have not yet broadcasted,
but add their signatures on (<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> for node 0, <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> for node 2). Both honest nodes saw
<span class="math inline">\({x, y, w}\)</span>.</small></i>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>If the problem demands choosing one value, they can use some "choice"
function to pick a single value out of the values they have seen (eg.
they take the one with the lowest hash). The nodes can then agree on
this value.</p>
<p>Now, let's explore why this works. What we need to prove is that if
one honest node has seen a particular value (validly), then every other
honest node has also seen that value (and if we prove this, then we know
that all honest nodes have seen the same set of values, and so if all
honest nodes are running the same choice function, they will choose the
same value). Suppose that any honest node receives a message <span
class="math inline">\(v : i[1] : ... : i[k]\)</span> that they perceive
to be valid (ie. it arrives before time <span class="math inline">\(T +
k \cdot D\)</span>). Suppose <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is
the index of a single other honest node. Either <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is part of <span
class="math inline">\({i[1] ... i[k]}\)</span> or it is not.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the first case (say <span class="math inline">\(x = i[j]\)</span>
for this message), we know that the honest node <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> had already broadcasted that message,
and they did so in response to a message with <span
class="math inline">\(j-1\)</span> signatures that they received before
time <span class="math inline">\(T + (j-1) \cdot D\)</span>, so they
broadcast their message at that time, and so the message must have been
received by all honest nodes before time <span class="math inline">\(T +
j \cdot D\)</span>.</li>
<li>In the second case, since the honest node sees the message before
time <span class="math inline">\(T + k \cdot D\)</span>, then they will
broadcast the message with their signature and guarantee that everyone,
including <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, will see it before
time <span class="math inline">\(T + (k+1) \cdot D\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that the algorithm uses the act of adding one's own signature
as a kind of "bump" on the timeout of a message, and it's this ability
that guarantees that if one honest node saw a message on time, they can
ensure that everyone else sees the message on time as well, as the
definition of "on time" increments by more than network latency with
every added signature.</p>
<p>In the case where one node is honest, can we guarantee that passive
<em>observers</em> (ie. non-consensus-participating nodes that care
about knowing the outcome) can also see the outcome, even if we require
them to be watching the process the whole time? With the scheme as
written, there's a problem. Suppose that a commander and some subset of
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> (malicious) validators produce a
message <span class="math inline">\(v : i[1] : .... : i[k]\)</span>, and
broadcast it directly to some "victims" just before time <span
class="math inline">\(T + k \cdot D\)</span>. The victims see the
message as being "on time", but when they rebroadcast it, it only
reaches all honest consensus-participating nodes after <span
class="math inline">\(T + k \cdot D\)</span>, and so all honest
consensus-participating nodes reject it.</p>
<center>
<img src="../../../..../../../../images/99-fault-tolerant-files/Lamport2.png" class="padded" />
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>But we can plug this hole. We require <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> to be a bound on <em>two times</em>
network latency plus clock disparity. We then put a different timeout on
observers: an observer accepts <span class="math inline">\(v : i[1] :
.... : i[k]\)</span> before time <span class="math inline">\(T + (k -
0.5) \cdot D\)</span>. Now, suppose an observer sees a message an
accepts it. They will be able to broadcast it to an honest node before
time <span class="math inline">\(T + k \cdot D\)</span>, and the honest
node will issue the message with their signature attached, which will
reach all other observers before time <span class="math inline">\(T + (k
+ 0.5) \cdot D\)</span>, the timeout for messages with <span
class="math inline">\(k+1\)</span> signatures.</p>

<h3 id="retrofitting-onto-other-consensus-algorithms">Retrofitting onto
other consensus algorithms</h3>
<p>The above could theoretically be used as a standalone consensus
algorithm, and could even be used to run a proof-of-stake blockchain.
The validator set of round <span class="math inline">\(N+1\)</span> of
the consensus could itself be decided during round <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> of the consensus (eg. each round of a
consensus could also accept "deposit" and "withdraw" transactions, which
if accepted and correctly signed would add or remove validators into the
next round). The main additional ingredient that would need to be added
is a mechanism for deciding who is allowed to propose blocks (eg. each
round could have one designated proposer). It could also be modified to
be usable as a proof-of-work blockchain, by allowing
consensus-participating nodes to "declare themselves" in real time by
publishing a proof of work solution on top of their public key at th
same time as signing a message with it.</p>
<p>However, the synchrony assumption is very strong, and so we would
like to be able to work without it in the case where we don't need more
than 33% or 50% fault tolerance. There is a way to accomplish this.
Suppose that we have some other consensus algorithm (eg. PBFT, Casper
FFG, chain-based PoS) whose output <em>can</em> be seen by
occasionally-online observers (we'll call this the
<em>threshold-dependent</em> consensus algorithm, as opposed to the
algorithm above, which we'll call the <em>latency-dependent</em>
consensus algorithm). Suppose that the threshold-dependent consensus
algorithm runs continuously, in a mode where it is constantly
"finalizing" new blocks onto a chain (ie. each finalized value points to
some previous finalized value as a "parent"; if there's a sequence of
pointers <span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow ... \rightarrow
B\)</span>, we'll call <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> a
<em>descendant</em> of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>).</p>
<p>We can retrofit the latency-dependent algorithm onto this structure,
giving always-online observers access to a kind of "strong finality" on
checkpoints, with fault tolerance ~95% (you can push this arbitrarily
close to 100% by adding more validators and requiring the process to
take longer).</p>
<p>Every time the time reaches some multiple of 4096 seconds, we run the
latency-dependent algorithm, choosing 512 random nodes to participate in
the algorithm. A valid proposal is any valid chain of values that were
finalized by the threshold-dependent algorithm. If a node sees some
finalized value before time <span class="math inline">\(T + k \cdot
D\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> = 8 seconds) with
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> signatures, it accepts the chain
into its set of known chains and rebroadcasts it with its own signature
added; observers use a threshold of <span class="math inline">\(T + (k -
0.5) \cdot D\)</span> as before.</p>
<p>The "choice" function used at the end is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finalized values that are not descendants of what was already agreed
to be a finalized value in the previous round are ignored</li>
<li>Finalized values that are invalid are ignored</li>
<li>To choose between two valid finalized values, pick the one with the
lower hash</li>
</ul>
<p>If 5% of validators are honest, there is only a roughly 1 in 1
trillion chance that none of the 512 randomly selected nodes will be
honest, and so as long as the network latency plus clock disparity is
less than <span class="math inline">\(\frac{D}{2}\)</span> the above
algorithm will work, correctly coordinating nodes on some single
finalized value, even if multiple conflicting finalized values are
presented because the fault tolerance of the threshold-dependent
algorithm is broken.</p>
<p>If the fault tolerance of the threshold-dependent consensus algorithm
is met (usually 50% or 67% honest), then the threshold-dependent
consensus algorithm will either not finalize any new checkpoints, or it
will finalize new checkpoints that are compatible with each other (eg. a
series of checkpoints where each points to the previous as a parent), so
even if network latency exceeds <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{D}{2}\)</span> (or even <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span>), and as a result nodes participating
in the latency-dependent algorithm disagree on which value they accept,
the values they accept are still guaranteed to be part of the same chain
and so there is no actual disagreement. Once latency recovers back to
normal in some future round, the latency-dependent consensus will get
back "in sync".</p>
<p>If the assumptions of both the threshold-dependent and
latency-dependent consensus algorithms are broken <em>at the same
time</em> (or in consecutive rounds), then the algorithm can break down.
For example, suppose in one round, the threshold-dependent consensus
finalizes <span class="math inline">\(Z \rightarrow Y \rightarrow
X\)</span> and the latency-dependent consensus disagrees between <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, and in the next round the
threshold-dependent consensus finalizes a descendant <span
class="math inline">\(W\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> which is <em>not</em> a descendant of
<span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>; in the latency-dependent
consensus, the nodes who agreed <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>
will not accept <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>, but the nodes
that agreed <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> will. However, this
is unavoidable; the impossibility of safe-under-asynchrony consensus
with more than <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{3}\)</span> fault
tolerance is a <a
href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/jacm88.pdf">well
known result</a> in Byzantine fault tolerance theory, as is the
impossibility of more than <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> fault tolerance even allowing
synchrony assumptions but assuming offline observers.</p>
