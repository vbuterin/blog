<title> Control as Liability </title>

<p>The regulatory and legal environment around internet-based services
and applications has changed considerably over the last decade. When
large-scale social networking platforms first became popular in the
2000s, the general attitude toward mass data collection was essentially
"why not?". This was the age of Mark Zuckerberg <a
href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/external/readwriteweb/2010/01/10/10readwriteweb-facebooks-zuckerberg-says-the-age-of-privac-82963.html">saying
the age of privacy is over</a> and Eric Schmidt <a
href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/12/google-ceo-eric-schmidt-dismisses-privacy">arguing</a>,
"If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you
shouldn't be doing it in the first place." And it made personal sense
for them to argue this: every bit of data you can get about others was a
potential machine learning advantage for you, every single restriction a
weakness, and if something happened to that data, the costs were
relatively minor. Ten years later, things are very different.</p>
<p>It is especially worth zooming in on a few particular trends.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong>. Over the last ten years, a number of
privacy laws have been passed, most aggressively in Europe but also
elsewhere, but the most recent is <a href="https://gdpr.eu/">the
GDPR</a>. The GDPR has many parts, but among the most prominent are: (i)
requirements for explicit consent, (ii) requirement to have a legal
basis to process data, (iii) users' right to download all their data,
(iv) users' right to require you to delete all their data. Other <a
href="https://www.riskmanagementmonitor.com/canadas-own-gdpr-now-in-effect/">jurisdictions</a>
are <a
href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/australia-likely-to-get-its-own-gdpr/">exploring</a>
similar rules.</li>
<li><strong>Data localization rules</strong>. <a
href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/the-india-draft-bill-on-data-protection-draws-inspiration-from-gdpr-but-has-its-limits/articleshow/65173684.cms?from=mdr">India</a>,
<a
href="https://iapp.org/resources/topics/russias-data-localization-law/">Russia</a>
and many other jurisdictions increasingly <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_localization">have or are
exploring</a> rules that require data on users within the country to be
stored inside the country. And even when explicit laws do not exist,
there's a growing shift toward concern (eg. <a
href="https://qz.com/1613020/tiktok-might-be-a-chinese-cambridge-analytica-scale-privacy-threat/">1</a>
<a
href="https://thenextweb.com/podium/2019/03/09/eu-wants-tech-independence-from-the-us-but-itll-be-tricky/">2</a>)
around data being moved to countries that are perceived to not
sufficiently protect it.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing economy regulation</strong>. Sharing economy
companies such as Uber <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/11/uber-driver-employee-ruling">are
having a hard time</a> arguing to courts that, given the extent to which
their applications control and direct drivers' activity, they should not
be legally classified as employers.</li>
<li><strong>Cryptocurrency regulation</strong>. A <a
href="https://www.systems.cs.cornell.edu/docs/fincen-cvc-guidance-final.pdf">recent
FINCEN guidance</a> attempts to clarify what categories of
cryptocurrency-related activity are and are not subject to regulatory
licensing requirements in the United States. Running a hosted wallet?
Regulated. Running a wallet where the user controls their funds? Not
regulated. Running an anonymizing mixing service? If you're
<em>running</em> it, regulated. If you're just writing code... <em>not
regulated</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As <a
href="https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1126527690264195082">Emin
Gun Sirer points out</a>, the FINCEN cryptocurrency guidance is not at
all haphazard; rather, it's trying to separate out categories of
applications where the developer is actively controlling funds, from
applications where the developer has no control. The guidance carefully
separates out how <em>multisignature wallets</em>, where keys are held
both by the operator and the user, are sometimes regulated and sometimes
not:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the multiple-signature wallet provider restricts its role to
creating un-hosted wallets that require adding a second authorization
key to the wallet owner's private key in order to validate and complete
transactions, the provider is not a money transmitter because it does
not accept and transmit value. On the other hand, if ... the value is
represented as an entry in the accounts of the provider, the owner does
not interact with the payment system directly, or the provider maintains
total independent control of the value, the provider will also qualify
as a money transmitter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although these events are taking place across a variety of contexts
and industries, I would argue that there is a common trend at play. And
the trend is this: <strong>control over users' data and digital
possessions and activity is rapidly moving from an asset to a
liability</strong>. Before, every bit of control you have was good: it
gives you more flexibility to earn revenue, if not now then in the
future. Now, every bit of control you have is a liability: you might be
regulated because of it. If you exhibit control over your users'
cryptocurrency, you are a money transmitter. If you have "sole
discretion over fares, and can charge drivers a cancellation fee if they
choose not to take a ride, prohibit drivers from picking up passengers
not using the app and suspend or deactivate drivers' accounts", you are
an employer. If you control your users' data, you're required to make
sure you can argue just cause, have a compliance officer, and give your
users access to download or delete the data.</p>
<p>If you are an application builder, and you are both lazy and fear
legal trouble, there is one easy way to make sure that you violate none
of the above new rules: <em>don't build applications that centralize
control</em>. If you build a wallet where the user holds their private
keys, you really are still "just a software provider". If you build a
"decentralized Uber" that really is just a slick UI combining a payment
system, a reputation system and a search engine, and don't control the
components yourself, you really won't get hit by many of the same legal
issues. If you build a website that just... doesn't collect data (Static
web pages? But that's impossible!) you don't have to even think about
the GDPR.</p>
<p>This kind of approach is of course not realistic for everyone. There
will continue to be many cases where going without the conveniences of
centralized control simply sacrifices too much for both developers and
users, and there are also cases where the business model considerations
mandate a more centralized approach (eg. it's easier to prevent
non-paying users from using software if the software stays on your
servers) win out. But we're definitely very far from having explored the
full range of possibilities that more decentralized approaches
offer.</p>
<p>Generally, unintended consequences of laws, discouraging entire
categories of activity when one wanted to only surgically forbid a few
specific things, are considered to be a bad thing. Here though, I would
argue that the forced shift in developers' mindsets, from "I want to
control more things just in case" to "I want to control fewer things
just in case", also has many positive consequences. Voluntarily giving
up control, and voluntarily taking steps to deprive oneself of the
ability to do mischief, does not come naturally to many people, and
while ideologically-driven decentralization-maximizing projects exist
today, it's not at all obvious at first glance that such services will
continue to dominate as the industry mainstreams. What this trend in
regulation does, however, is that it gives a big nudge in favor of those
applications that are willing to take the centralization-minimizing,
user-sovereignty-maximizing "can't be evil" route.</p>
<p>Hence, even though these regulatory changes are arguably not
pro-freedom, at least if one is concerned with the freedom of
application developers, and the transformation of the internet into a
subject of political focus is bound to have many negative knock-on
effects, the particular trend of control becoming a liability is in a
strange way <em>even more pro-cypherpunk</em> (even if not
intentionally!) than policies of maximizing total freedom for
application developers would have been. Though the present-day
regulatory landscape is very far from an optimal one from the point of
view of almost anyone's preferences, it has unintentionally dealt the
movement for minimizing unneeded centralization and maximizing users'
control of their own assets, private keys and data a surprisingly strong
hand to execute on its vision. And it would be highly beneficial to the
movement to take advantage of it.</p>
