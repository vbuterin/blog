<title> Sidechains vs Plasma vs Sharding </title>

<p><em>Special thanks to Jinglan Wang for review and feedback</em></p>
<p>One question that often comes up is: how exactly is sharding
different from sidechains or Plasma? All three architectures seem to
involve a hub-and-spoke architecture with a central "main chain" that
serves as the consensus backbone of the system, and a set of "child"
chains containing actual user-level transactions. Hashes from the child
chains are usually periodically published into the main chain (sharded
chains with no hub are theoretically possible but haven't been done so
far; this article will not focus on them, but the arguments are
similar). Given this fundamental similarity, why go with one approach
over the others?</p>
<p>Distinguishing sidechains from Plasma is simple. Plasma chains are
sidechains that have a non-custodial property: if there is any error in
the Plasma chain, then the error can be detected, and users can safely
exit the Plasma chain and prevent the attacker from doing any lasting
damage. The only cost that users suffer is that they must wait for a
challenge period and pay some higher transaction fees on the
(non-scalable) base chain. Regular sidechains do not have this safety
property, so they are less secure. However, designing Plasma chains is
in many cases much harder, and one could argue that for many low-value
applications the security is not worth the added complexity.</p>
<p>So what about Plasma versus sharding? The key technical difference
has to do with the notion of <strong>tight coupling</strong>. Tight
coupling is a property of sharding, but NOT a property of sidechains or
Plasma, that says that the validity of the main chain ("beacon chain" in
ethereum 2.0) is inseparable from the validity of the child chains. That
is, a child chain block that specifies an invalid main chain block as a
dependency is by definition invalid, and more importantly a main chain
block that includes an invalid child chain block is by definition
invalid.</p>
<p>In non-sharded blockchains, this idea that the canonical chain (ie.
the chain that everyone accepts as representing the "real" history) is
<em>by definition</em> fully available and valid also applies; for
example in the case of Bitcoin and Ethereum one typically says that the
canonical chain is the "longest valid chain" (or, more pedantically, the
"heaviest valid and available chain"). In sharded blockchains, this idea
that the canonical chain is the heaviest valid and available chain
<em>by definition</em> also applies, with the validity and availability
requirement applying to both the main chain and shard chains. The new
challenge that a sharded system has, however, is that users have no way
of fully verifying the validity and availability of any given chain
<em>directly</em>, because there is too much data. The challenge of
engineering sharded chains is to get around this limitation by giving
users a maximally trustless and practical <em>indirect</em> means to
verify which chains are fully available and valid, so that they can
still determine which chain is canonical. In practice, this includes
techniques like committees, SNARKs/STARKs, fisherman schemes and <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09044">fraud and data availability
proofs</a>.</p>
<p>If a chain structure does not have this tight-coupling property, then
it is arguably not a layer-1 sharding scheme, but rather a layer-2
system sitting on top of a non-scalable layer-1 chain. Plasma is not a
tightly-coupled system: an invalid Plasma block absolutely can have its
header be committed into the main Ethereum chain, because the Ethereum
base layer has no idea that it represents an invalid Plasma block, or
even that it represents a Plasma block at all; all that it sees is a
transaction containing a small piece of data. However, the consequences
of a single Plasma chain failing are localized to within that Plasma
chain.</p>

<p>However, if you try to analyze the process of <em>how</em> users
perform the "indirect validation" procedure to determine if the chain
they are looking at is fully valid and available without downloading and
executing the whole thing, one can find more similarities with how
Plasma works. For example, a common technique used to prevent
availability issues is fishermen: if a node sees a given piece of a
block as unavailable, it can publish a challenge claiming this, creating
a time period within which anyone can publish that piece of data. If a
block goes unchallenged for long enough, the blocks and all blocks that
cite it as a dependency can be reverted. This seems fundamentally
similar to Plasma, where if a block is unavailable users can publish a
message to the main chain to exit their state in response. Both
techniques eventually buckle under pressure in the same way: if there
are too many false challenges in a sharded system, then users cannot
keep track of whether or not all of the availability challenges have
been answered, and if there are too many availability challenges in a
Plasma system then the main chain could get overwhelmed as the exits
fill up the chain's block size limit. In both cases, it seems like
there's a system that has nominally <span
class="math inline">\(O(C^2)\)</span> scalability (where <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is the computing power of one node) but
where scalability falls to <span class="math inline">\(O(C)\)</span> in
the event of an attack. However, sharding has more defenses against
this.</p>
<p>First of all, modern sharded designs use randomly sampled committees,
so one cannot easily dominate even one committee enough to produce a
fake block unless one has a large portion (perhaps <span
class="math inline">\(&gt;\frac{1}{3}\)</span>) of the entire validator
set of the chain. Second, there are better strategies to handling data
availability than fishermen: data availability proofs. In a scheme using
data availability proofs, if a block is <em>unavailable</em>, then
clients' data availability checks will fail and clients will see that
block as unavailable. If the block is <em>invalid</em>, then even a
single fraud proof will convince them of this fact for an entire block.
An <span class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span>-sized fraud proof can
convince a client of the invalidity of an <span
class="math inline">\(O(C)\)</span>-sized block, and so <span
class="math inline">\(O(C)\)</span> data suffices to convince a client
of the invalidity of <span class="math inline">\(O(C^2)\)</span> data
(this is in the worst case where the client is dealing with <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> sister blocks all with the same parent
of which only one is valid; in more likely cases, one single fraud proof
suffices to prove invalidity of an entire invalid chain). Hence, sharded
systems are theoretically less vulnerable to being overwhelmed by
denial-of-service attacks than Plasma chains.</p>
<p>Second, sharded chains provide stronger guarantees in the face of
large and majority attackers (with more than <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{3}\)</span> or even <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> of the validator set). A
Plasma chain can always be successfully attacked by a 51% attack on the
main chain that censors exits; a sharded chain cannot. This is because
data availability proofs and fraud proofs happen <em>inside the
client</em>, rather than <em>inside the chain</em>, so they cannot be
censored by 51% attacks. Third, the defenses provided by sharded chains
are easier to generalize; Plasma's model of exits requires state to be
separated into discrete pieces each of which is in the interest of any
single actor to maintain, whereas sharded chains relying on data
availability proofs, fraud proofs, fishermen and random sampling are
theoretically universal.</p>
<p>So there really is a large difference between validity and
availability guarantees that are provided at layer 2, which are limited
and more complex as they require explicit reasoning about incentives and
which party has an interest in which pieces of state, and guarantees
that are provided by a layer 1 system that is committed to fully
satisfying them.</p>
<p>But Plasma chains also have large advantages too. First, they can be
iterated and new designs can be implemented more quickly, as each Plasma
chain can be deployed separately without coordinating the rest of the
ecosystem. Second, sharding is inherently more fragile, as it attempts
to guarantee absolute and total availability and validity of some
quantity of data, and this quantity must be set in the protocol; too
little, and the system has less scalability than it could have had, too
much, and the entire system risks breaking. The maximum safe level of
scalability also depends on the number of users of the system, which is
an unpredictable variable. Plasma chains, on the other hand, allow
different users to make different tradeoffs in this regard, and allow
users to adjust more flexibly to changes in circumstances.</p>
<p>Single-operator Plasma chains can also be used to offer more privacy
than sharded systems, where all data is public. Even where privacy is
not desired, they are potentially more efficient, because the total data
availability requirement of sharded systems requires a large extra level
of redundancy as a safety margin. In Plasma systems, on the other hand,
data requirements for each piece of data can be minimized, to the point
where in the long term each individual piece of data may only need to be
replicated a few times, rather than a thousand times as is the case in
sharded systems.</p>
<p>Hence, in the long term, a hybrid system where a sharded base layer
exists, and Plasma chains exist on top of it to provide further
scalability, seems like the most likely approach, more able to serve
different groups' of users need than sole reliance on one strategy or
the other. And it is unfortunately <em>not</em> the case that at a
sufficient level of advancement Plasma and sharding collapse into the
same design; the two are in some key ways irreducibly different (eg. the
data availability checks made by clients in sharded systems
<em>cannot</em> be moved to the main chain in Plasma because these
checks only work if they are done subjectively and based on private
information). But both scalability solutions (as well as state
channels!) have a bright future ahead of them.</p>
