<title> Review of Gitcoin Quadratic Funding Round 3 </title>

<p><em>Special thanks to the Gitcoin team and especially Frank Chen for
working with me through these numbers</em></p>
<p>The next round of Gitcoin Grants quadratic funding has just finished,
and we the numbers for how much each project has received <a
href="https://gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoins-q3-match/">were just
released</a>. Here are the top ten:</p>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/gitcoin-files/round3.png" style="width:750px" />
</center>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>Altogether, $163,279 was donated to 80 projects by 477 contributors,
augmented by a matching pool of $100,000. Nearly half came from four
contributions above $10,000: $37,500 to Lighthouse, and $12,500 each to
Gas Station Network, Black Girls Code and Public Health Incentives
Layer. Out of the remainder, about half came from contributions between
$1,000 and $10,000, and the rest came from smaller donations of various
sizes. But what matters more here are not the raw donations, but rather
the subsidies that the <a
href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3243656">quadratic
funding</a> mechanism applied. Gitcoin Grants is there to support
valuable public goods in the Ethereum ecosystem, but also serve as a
testbed for this new quadratic donation matching mechanism, and see how
well it lives up to its promise of creating a democratic, market-based
and efficient way of funding public goods. This time around, a modified
formula based on <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/pairwise-coordination-subsidies-a-new-quadratic-funding-design/5553">pairwise-bounded
coordination subsidies</a> was used, which has the goal of minimizing
distortion from large contributions from coordinated actors. And now we
get to see how the experiment went.</p>
<h3 id="judging-the-outcomes">Judging the Outcomes</h3>
<p>First, the results. Ultimately, every mechanism for allocating
resources, whether centralized, market-based, democratic or otherwise,
must stand the test of delivering results, or else sooner or later it
will be abandoned for another mechanism that is perceived to be better,
even if it is less philosophically clean. Judging results is inherently
a subjective exercise; any single person's analysis of a mechanism will
inevitably be shaped by how well the results fit their own preferences
and tastes. However, in those cases where a mechanism does output a
surprising result, one can and should use that as an opportunity to
learn, and see whether or not one missed some key information that other
participants in the mechanism had.</p>
<p>In my own case, I found the top results very agreeable and a quite
reasonable catalogue of projects that are good for the Ethereum
community. One of the disparities between these grants and the Ethereum
Foundation grants is that the Ethereum Foundation grants (see recent
rounds <a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/08/26/announcing-ethereum-foundation-and-co-funded-grants/">here</a>
and <a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/02/21/ethereum-foundation-grants-program-wave-5/">here</a>)
tend to overwhelmingly focus on technology with only a small section on
education and community resources, whereas in the Gitcoin grants while
technology still dominates, EthHub is #2 and lower down defiprime.com is
#14 and cryptoeconomics.study is #17. In this case my personal opinion
is that EF <em>has</em> made a genuine error in undervaluing grants to
community/education organizations and Gitcoin's "collective instinct" is
correct. Score one for new-age fancy quadratic market democracy.</p>
<p>Another surprising result to me was Austin Griffith getting second
place. I personally have never spent too much time thinking about Burner
Wallet; I knew that it existed but in my mental space I did not take it
too seriously, focusing instead on client development, L2 scaling,
privacy and to a lesser extent smart contract wallets (the latter being
a key use case of Gas Station Network at #8). After seeing Austin's
impressive performance in this Gitcoin round, I asked a few people what
was going on.</p>
<p>Burner Wallet (<a href="https://xdai.io/">website</a>, <a
href="https://settle.finance/blog/what-is-the-burner-wallet-and-whats-xdai/">explainer
article</a>) is an "insta-wallet" that's very easy to use: just load it
up on your desktop or phone, and there you have it. It was used
successfully at EthDenver to sell food from food trucks, and generally
many people appreciate its convenience. Its main weaknesses are lower
security and that one of its features, support for xDAI, is dependent on
a permissioned chain.</p>
<p>Austin's Gitcoin grant is there to fund his <a
href="https://gitcoin.co/grants/122/austin-griffith-ethereum-rampd">ongoing
work</a>, and I have heard one criticism: there's many prototypes, but
comparatively few "things taken to completion". There is also the
critique that as great as Austin is, it's difficult to argue that he's
as important to the success of Ethereum as, say, Lighthouse and
Prysmatic, though one can reply that what matters is not total value,
but rather the marginal value of giving a given project or person an
extra $10,000. On the whole, however, I feel like quadratic funding's
(Glen would say deliberate!) tendency to select for things like Burner
Wallet with populist appeal is a much needed corrective to the influence
of the Ethereum tech elite (including myself!) who often value technical
impressiveness and undervalue simple and quick things that make it
really easy for people to participate in Ethereum. This one is slightly
more ambiguous, but I'll say score two for new-age fancy quadratic
market democracy.</p>
<p>The main thing that I was disappointed the Gitcoiner-ati did
<em>not</em> support more was Gitcoin maintenance itself. The Gitcoin
Sustainability Fund only got a total $1,119 in raw contributions from 18
participants, plus a match of $202. The optional 5% tips that users
could give to Gitcoin upon donating were not included into the quadratic
matching calculations, but raised another ~$1,000. Given the amount of
effort the Gitcoin people put in to making quadratic funding possible,
this is not nearly enough; Gitcoin clearly deserves more than 0.9% of
the total donations in the round. Meanwhile, the Ethereum Foundation (as
well as Consensys and individual donors) have been giving grants to
Gitcoin that include supporting Gitcoin itself. Hopefully in future
rounds people will support Gitcoin itself too, but for now, score one
for good old-fashioned EF technocracy.</p>
<p>On the whole, quadratic funding, while still young and immature,
seems to be a remarkably effective complement to the funding preferences
of existing institutions, and it seems worthwhile to continue it and
even increase its scope and size in the future.</p>
<h3
id="pairwise-bounded-quadratic-funding-vs-traditional-quadratic-funding">Pairwise-bounded
quadratic funding vs traditional quadratic funding</h3>
<p>Round 3 differs from previous rounds in that it uses a new <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/pairwise-coordination-subsidies-a-new-quadratic-funding-design/5553">flavor
of quadratic funding</a>, which limits the subsidy per pair of
participants. For example, in traditional QF, if two people each donate
$10, the subsidy would be $10, and if two people each donate $10,000,
the subsidy would be $10,000. This property of traditional QF makes it
highly vulnerable to collusion: two key employees of a project (or even
two fake accounts owned by the same person) could each donate as much
money as they have, and get back a very large subsidy. Pairwise-bounded
QF computes the total subsidy to a project by looking through all pairs
of contributors, and imposes a maximum bound on the total subsidy that
any given pair of participants can trigger (combined across all
projects). Pairwise-bounded QF also has the property that it generally
penalizes projects that are dominated by large contributors:</p>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/gitcoin-files/chart2.png" class="padded" />
</center>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>The projects that lost the most relative to traditional QF seem to be
projects that have a single large contribution (or sometimes two). For
example, "fuzz geth and Parity for EVM consensus bugs" got a $415 match
compared to the $2000 he would have gotten in traditional QF; the
decrease is explained by the fact that the contributions are dominated
by two large $4500 contributions. On the other hand, <a
href="http://cryptoeconomics.study">cryptoeconomics.study</a> got $1274,
<em>up</em> nearly double from the $750 it would have gotten in
traditional QF; this is explained by the large diversity of
contributions that the project received and particularly the lack of
large sponsors: the largest contribution to cryptoeconomics.study was
$100.</p>
<p>Another desirable property of pairwise-bounded QF is that it
privileges <em>cross-tribal</em> projects. That is, if there are
projects that group A typically supports, and projects that group B
typically supports, then projects that manage to get support from both
groups get a more favorable subsidy (because the pairs that go between
groups are not as saturated). Has this incentive for building bridges
appeared in these results?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my code of honor as a social scientist obliges me to
report the negative result: the Ethereum community just does not yet
have enough internal tribal structure for effects like this to
materialize, and even when there are differences in correlations they
don't seem strongly connected to higher subsidies due to
pairwise-bounding. Here are the cross-correlations between who
contributed to different projects:</p>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/gitcoin-files/correlations.png" />
</center>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>Generally, all projects are slightly positively correlated with each
other, with a few exceptions with greater correlation and one exception
with broad roughly zero correlation: <a
href="https://gitcoin.co/grants/120/nori">Nori</a> (120 in this chart).
However, Nori did not do well in pairwise-bounded QF, because over 94%
of its donations came from a single $5000 donation.</p>
<h3 id="dominance-of-large-projects">Dominance of large projects</h3>
<p>One other pattern that we saw in this round is that popular projects
got disproportionately large grants:</p>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/gitcoin-files/ratios.jpeg" class="padded" />
</center>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>To be clear, this is not just saying "more contributions, more
match", it's saying "more contributions, <em>more match per dollar
contributed</em>". Arguably, this is an intended feature of the
mechanism. Projects that can get more people to donate to them represent
public goods that serve a larger public, and so tragedy of the commons
problems are more severe and hence contributions to them should be
multiplied more to compensate. However, looking at the list, it's hard
to argue that, say, Prysm ($3,848 contributed, $8,566 matched) is a more
public good than Nimbus ($1,129 contributed, $496 matched; for the
unaware, Prysm and Nimbus are both eth2 clients). The failure does not
look too severe; on average, projects near the top do seem to serve a
larger public and projects near the bottom do seem niche, but it seems
clear that at least part of the disparity is not genuine publicness of
the good, but rather inequality of attention. N units of marketing
effort can attract attention of N people, and theoretically get N^2
resources.</p>
<p>Of course, this could be solved via a "layer on top" venture-capital
style: upstart new projects could get investors to support them, in
return for a share of matched contributions received when they get
large. Something like this would be needed eventually; predicting future
public goods is as important a social function as predicting future
private goods. But we could also consider less winner-take-all
alternatives; the simplest one would be adjusting the QF formula so it
uses an exponent of eg. 1.5 instead of 2. I can see it being worthwhile
to try a future round of Gitcoin Grants with such a formula (<span
class="math inline">\(\left(\sum_i
x_i^{\frac{2}{3}}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}\)</span> instead of <span
class="math inline">\(\left(\sum_i x_i^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)^2\)</span>)
to see what the results are like.</p>
<h3 id="individual-leverage-curves">Individual leverage curves</h3>
<p>One key question is, if you donate $1, or $5, or $100, how big an
impact can you have on the amount of money that a project gets?
Fortunately, we can use the data to calculate these deltas!</p>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/gitcoin-files/deltas.png" class="padded" />
</center>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>The different lines are for different projects; supporting projects
with higher existing support will lead to you getting a bigger
multiplier. In all cases, the first dollar is very valuable, with a
matching ratio in some cases over 100:1. But the second dollar is much
less valuable, and matching ratios quickly taper off; even for the
largest projects increasing one's donation from $32 to $64 will only get
a 1:1 match, and anything above $100 becomes almost a straight donation
with nearly no matching. However, given that it's likely possible to get
legitimate-looking Github accounts on the grey market for around those
costs, having a cap of a few hundred dollars on the amount of matched
funds that any particular account can direct seems like a very
reasonable mitigation, despite its costs in limiting the bulk of the
matching effect to small-sized donations.</p>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>On the whole, this was by far the largest and the most data-rich
Gitcoin funding round to date. It successfully attracted hundreds of
contributors, reaching a size where we can finally see many significant
effects in play and drown out the effects of the more naive forms of
small-scale collusion. The experiment already seems to be leading to
valuable information that can be used by future quadratic funding
implementers to improve their quadratic funding implementations. The
case of Austin Griffith is also interesting because $23,911 in funds
that he received comes, in relative terms, surprisingly close to an
average salary for a developer if the grants can be repeated on a
regular schedule. What this means is that if Gitcoin Grants
<em>does</em> continue operating regularly, and attracts and expands its
pool of donations, we could be very close to seeing the first "quadratic
freelancer" - someone directly "working for the public", funded by
donations boosted by quadratic matching subsidies. And at that point we
could start to see more experimentation in new forms of organization
that live on top of quadratic funding gadgets as a base layer. All in
all, this foretells an exciting and, err, radical public-goods funding
future ahead of us.</p>
