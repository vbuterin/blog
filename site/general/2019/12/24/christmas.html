<title> Christmas Special </title>

<p>Since it's Christmas time now, and we're theoretically supposed to be
enjoying ourselves and spending time with our families instead of waging
endless holy wars on Twitter, this blog post will offer some games that
you can play with your friends that will help you have fun <em>and</em>
at the same time understand some spooky mathematical concepts!</p>
<h3 id="dimensional-chess">1.58 dimensional chess</h3>
<center>
<br> <a
href="https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1138777837320716288"><img
src="../../../../images/christmas-files/chess_tweet.jpg" /></a> <br><br>
</center>
<p>This is a variant of chess where the board is set up like this:</p>
<center>
<br> <img src="../../../../images/christmas-files/chess.png" /> <br><br>
</center>
<p>The board is still a normal 8x8 board, but there are only 27 open
squares. The other 37 squares should be covered up by checkers or Go
pieces or anything else to denote that they are inaccessible. The rules
are the same as chess, with a few exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>White pawns move up, black pawns move left. White pawns take going
left-and-up or right-and-up, black pawns take going left-and-down or
left-and-up. White pawns promote upon reaching the top, black pawns
promote upon reaching the left.</li>
<li>No en passant, castling, or two-step-forward pawn jumps.</li>
<li>Chess pieces cannot move onto <em>or through</em> the 37 covered
squares. Knights cannot move onto the 37 covered squares, but don't care
what they move "through".</li>
</ul>
<p>The game is called 1.58 dimensional chess because the 27 open squares
are chosen according to a pattern based on the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle">Sierpinski
triangle</a>. You start off with a single open square, and then every
time you double the width, you take the shape at the end of the previous
step, and copy it to the top left, top right and bottom left corners,
but leave the bottom right corner inaccessible. Whereas in a
one-dimensional structure, doubling the width increases the space by 2x,
and in a two-dimensional structure, doubling the width increases the
space by 4x (4 = 2<sup>2</sup>), and in a three-dimensional structure,
doubling the width increases the space by 8x (8 = 2<sup>3</sup>), here
doubling the width increases the space by 3x (3 = 2<sup>1.58496</sup>),
hence "1.58 dimensional" (see <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension">Hausdorff
dimension</a> for details).</p>
<p>The game is substantially simpler and more "tractable" than full-on
chess, and it's an interesting exercise in showing how in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland">lower-dimensional
spaces</a> defense becomes much easier than offense. Note that the
relative value of different pieces may change here, and new kinds of
endings become possible (eg. you can checkmate with just a bishop).</p>
<h3 id="dimensional-tic-tac-toe">3 dimensional tic tac toe</h3>

<br> <img src="../../../../images/christmas-files/tic4.png"
class="padded" /> <br><br>
</center>
<p>The goal here is to get 4 in a straight line, where the line can go
in any direction, along an axis or diagonal, including between planes.
For example in this configuration X wins:</p>
<center>
<br> <img src="../../../../images/christmas-files/tic4_2.png"
class="padded" /> <br><br>
</center>
<p>It's considerably harder than <a
href="https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-way-to-never-lose-at-Tic-Tac-Toe">traditional
2D tic tac toe</a>, and hopefully much more fun!</p>
<h3 id="modular-tic-tac-toe">Modular tic-tac-toe</h3>
<p>Here, we go back down to having two dimensions, except we allow lines
to wrap around:</p>
<center>
<br> <img src="../../../../images/christmas-files/tic4_3.png" />
<br><small><i>X wins</i></small>
</center>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>Note that we allow diagonal lines with any slope, as long as they
pass through all four points. Particularly, this means that lines with
slope +/- 2 and +/- 1/2 are admissible:</p>
<center>
<br> <img src="../../../../images/christmas-files/tic4_4.png" />
<br><br>
</center>
<p>Mathematically, the board can be interpreted as a 2-dimensional
vector space over <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic">integers modulo
4</a>, and the goal being to fill in a line that passes through four
points over this space. Note that there exists at least one line passing
through any two points.</p>
<h3 id="tic-tac-toe-over-the-4-element-binary-field">Tic tac toe over
the 4-element binary field</h3>
<center>
<br> <img src="../../../../images/christmas-files/tic4_5.png"
class="padded" /> <br><br>
</center>
<p>Here, we have the same concept as above, except we use an even
spookier mathematical structure, the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field#Field_with_four_elements">4-element
field</a> of polynomials over <span class="math inline">\(Z_2\)</span>
modulo <span class="math inline">\(x^2 + x + 1\)</span>. This structure
has pretty much no reasonable geometric interpretation, so I'll just
give you the addition and multiplication tables:</p>
<center>
<br> <img src="../../../../images/christmas-files/tic4_6.png"
class="padded" /> <br><br>
</center>
<p>OK fine, here are all possible lines, excluding the horizontal and
the vertical lines (which are also admissible) for brevity:</p>
<center>
<br>
<img src="../../../../images/christmas-files/tic4_7.png" style="width: 450px" class="padded" />
<br><br>
</center>
<p>The lack of geometric interpretation does make the game harder to
play; you pretty much have to memorize the twenty winning combinations,
though note that they are <em>basically</em> rotations and reflections
of the same four basic shapes (axial line, diagonal line, diagonal line
starting in the middle, that weird thing that doesn't look like a
line).</p>

1.77 dimensional connect four. I dare you.</h3>

<img src="../../../../images/christmas-files/tic4_8.png" style="width: 450px" />
<br><br>
</center>
<h3 id="modular-poker">Modular poker</h3>
<p>Everyone is dealt five (you can use whatever variant poker rules you
want here in terms of how these cards are dealt and whether or not
players have the right to swap cards out). The cards are interpreted as:
jack = 11, queen = 12, king = 0, ace = 1. A hand is stronger than
another hand, if it contains a longer sequence, with any constant
difference between consecutive cards (allowing wraparound), than the
other hand.</p>
<p>Mathametically, this can be represented as, a hand is stronger if the
player can come up with a line <span class="math inline">\(L(x) =
mx+b\)</span> such that they have cards for the numbers <span
class="math inline">\(L(0)\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(L(1)\)</span> ... <span
class="math inline">\(L(k)\)</span> for the highest <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<center>
<br> <img src="../../../../images/christmas-files/cards1.png" />
<br><small><i>Example of a full five-card winning hand. y = 4x +
5.</i></small>
</center>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>To break ties between equal maximum-length sequences, count the
number of distinct length-three sequences they have; the hand with more
distinct length-three sequences wins.</p>
<center>
<br> <img src="../../../../images/christmas-files/cards2.png" />
<br><small><i>This hand has four length-three sequences: K 2 4, K 4 8, 2
3 4, 3 8 K. This is rare.</i></small>
</center>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>Only consider lines of length three or higher. If a hand has three or
more of the same denomination, that counts as a sequence, but if a hand
has two of the same denomination, any sequences passing through that
denomination only count as one sequence.</p>
<center>
<br> <img src="../../../../images/christmas-files/cards3.png" />
<br><small><i>This hand has no length-three sequences.</i></small>
</center>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>If two hands are completely tied, the hand with the higher highest
card (using J = 11, Q = 12, K = 0, A = 1 as above) wins.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
