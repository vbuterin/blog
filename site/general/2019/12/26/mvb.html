<title> Base Layers And Functionality Escape Velocity </title>

<p>One common strand of thinking in blockchain land goes as follows:
blockchains should be maximally simple, because they are a piece of
infrastructure that is difficult to change and would lead to great harms
if it breaks, and more complex functionality should be built on top, in
the form of layer 2 protocols: <a
href="https://www.jeffcoleman.ca/state-channels/">state channels</a>, <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-viable-plasma/426">Plasma</a>, <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/on-chain-scaling-to-potentially-500-tx-sec-through-mass-tx-validation/3477">rollup</a>,
and so forth. Layer 2 should be the site of ongoing innovation, layer 1
should be the site of stability and maintenance, with large changes only
in emergencies (eg. a one-time set of serious breaking changes to
prevent the base protocol's cryptography from falling to quantum
computers would be okay).</p>
<p>This kind of layer separation is a very nice idea, and in the long
term I strongly support this idea. However, this kind of thinking misses
an important point: while layer 1 cannot be <em>too</em> powerful, as
greater power implies greater complexity and hence greater brittleness,
layer 1 must also be <em>powerful enough</em> for the layer 2
protocols-on-top that people want to build to actually be possible in
the first place. Once a layer 1 protocol has achieved a certain level of
functionality, which I will term "functionality escape velocity", then
yes, you can do everything else on top without further changing the
base. But if layer 1 is not powerful enough, then you can talk about
filling in the gap with layer 2 systems, but the reality is that there
is no way to actually build those systems, without reintroducing a whole
set of trust assumptions that the layer 1 was trying to get away from.
This post will talk about some of what this minimal functionality that
constitutes "functionality escape velocity" is.</p>
<h3 id="a-programming-language">A programming language</h3>
<p>It must be possible to execute custom user-generated scripts
on-chain. This programming language can be simple, and actually does not
need to be high-performance, but it needs to at least have the level of
functionality required to be able to verify arbitrary things that might
need to be verified. This is important because the layer 2 protocols
that are going to be built on top need to have some kind of verification
logic, and this verification logic must be executed by the blockchain
somehow.</p>
<p>You may have heard of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">Turing
completeness</a>; the "layman's intuition" for the term being that if a
programming language is Turing complete then it can do anything that a
computer theoretically could do. Any program in one Turing-complete
language can be translated into an equivalent program in any other
Turing-complete language. However, it turns out that we only need
something slightly lighter: it's okay to restrict to programs without
loops, or programs which are <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_functional_programming">guaranteed
to terminate</a> in a specific number of steps.</p>
<h3 id="rich-statefulness">Rich Statefulness</h3>
<p>It doesn't just matter that a programming language <em>exists</em>,
it also matters precisely how that programming language is integrated
into the blockchain. Among the more constricted ways that a language
could be integrated is if it is used for pure transaction verification:
when you send coins to some address, that address represents a computer
program <code>P</code> which would be used to verify a transaction that
sends coins <em>from</em> that address. That is, if you send a
transaction whose hash is <code>h</code>, then you would supply a
signature <code>S</code>, and the blockchain would run
<code>P(h, S)</code>, and if that outputs TRUE then the transaction is
valid. Often, <code>P</code> is a verifier for a cryptographic signature
scheme, but it could do more complex operations. Note particularly that
in this model <code>P</code> <em>does not have access</em> to the
destination of the transaction.</p>
<p>However, this "pure function" approach is not enough. This is because
this pure function-based approach is not powerful enough to implement
many kinds of layer 2 protocols that people actually want to implement.
It can do channels (and channel-based systems like the Lightning
Network), but it cannot implement other scaling techniques with stronger
properties, it cannot be used to bootstrap systems that do have more
complicated notions of state, and so forth.</p>
<p>To give a simple example of what the pure function paradigm cannot
do, consider a savings account with the following feature: there is a
cryptographic key <code>k</code> which can initiate a withdrawal, and if
a withdrawal is initiated, within the next 24 hours that same key
<code>k</code> can cancel the withdrawal. If a withdrawal remains
uncancelled within 24 hours, then anyone can "poke" the account to
finalize that withdrawal. The goal is that if the key is stolen, the
account holder can prevent the thief from withdrawing the funds. The
thief could of course prevent the legitimate owner from getting the
funds, but the attack would not be profitable for the thief and so they
would probably not bother with it (see <a
href="http://hackingdistributed.com/2016/02/26/how-to-implement-secure-bitcoin-vaults/">the
original paper</a> for an explanation of this technique).</p>
<p>Unfortunately this technique cannot be implemented with just pure
functions. The problem is this: there needs to be some way to move coins
from a "normal" state to an "awaiting withdrawal" state. But the program
<code>P</code> does not have access to the destination! Hence, any
transaction that could authorize moving the coins to an awaiting
withdrawal state could also authorize just stealing those coins
immediately; <code>P</code> can't tell the difference. The ability to
change the state of coins, without completely setting them free, is
important to many kinds of applications, including layer 2 protocols.
Plasma itself fits into this "authorize, finalize, cancel" paradigm: an
exit from Plasma must be approved, then there is a 7 day challenge
period, and within that challenge period the exit could be cancelled if
the right evidence is provided. Rollup also needs this property: coins
inside a rollup must be controlled by a program that keeps track of a
state root <code>R</code>, and changes from <code>R</code> to
<code>R'</code> if some verifier <code>P(R, R', data)</code> returns
TRUE - but it only changes the state to <code>R'</code> in that case, it
does not set the coins free.</p>
<p>This ability to authorize state changes without completely setting
all coins in an account free, is what I mean by "rich statefulness". It
can be implemented in many ways, some UTXO-based, but without it a
blockchain is not powerful enough to implement most layer 2 protocols,
without including trust assumptions (eg. a set of functionaries who are
collectively trusted to execute those richly-stateful programs).</p>
<p><small><i>Note: yes, I know that if <code>P</code> has access to
<code>h</code> then you can just include the destination address as part
of <code>S</code> and check it against <code>h</code>, and restrict
state changes that way. But it is possible to have a programming
language that is too resource-limited or otherwise restricted to
actually do this; and surprisingly this often actually is the case in
blockchain scripting languages.</i></small></p>
<h3 id="sufficient-data-scalability-and-low-latency">Sufficient data
scalability and low latency</h3>
<p>It turns out that plasma and channels, and other layer 2 protocols
that are fully off-chain have some fundamental weaknesses that prevent
them from fully replicating the capabilities of layer 1. I go into this
in detail <a href="../../../2019/08/28/hybrid_layer_2.html">here</a>;
the summary is that these protocols need to have a way of adjudicating
situations where some parties maliciously fail to provide data that they
promised to provide, and because data publication is not globally
verifiable (you don't know when data was published unless you already
downloaded it yourself) these adjudication games are not
game-theoretically stable. Channels and Plasma cleverly get around this
instability by adding additional assumptions, particularly assuming that
for every piece of state, there is a single actor that is interested in
that state not being incorrectly modified (usually because it represents
coins that they own) and so can be trusted to fight on its behalf.
However, this is far from general-purpose; systems like <a
href="http://uniswap.exchange">Uniswap</a>, for example, include a large
"central" contract that is not owned by anyone, and so they cannot
effectively be protected by this paradigm.</p>
<p>There is one way to get around this, which is layer 2 protocols that
publish very small amounts of data on-chain, but do computation entirely
off-chain. If data is guaranteed to be available, then computation being
done off-chain is okay, because games for adjudicating who did
computation correctly and who did it incorrectly <em>are</em>
game-theoretically stable (or could be replaced entirely by <a
href="../../../2017/02/01/zk_snarks.html">SNARKs</a> or <a
href="../../../2017/11/09/starks_part_1.html">STARKs</a>). This is the
logic behind <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/on-chain-scaling-to-potentially-500-tx-sec-through-mass-tx-validation/3477">ZK
rollup</a> and <a
href="https://medium.com/plasma-group/ethereum-smart-contracts-in-l2-optimistic-rollup-2c1cef2ec537">optimistic
rollup</a>. If a blockchain allows for the publication and guarantees
the availability of a reasonably large amount of data, even if its
capacity for <em>computation</em> remains very limited, then the
blockchain can support these layer-2 protocols and achieve a high level
of scalability <em>and</em> functionality.</p>
<p>Just how much data does the blockchain need to be able to process and
guarantee? Well, it depends on what TPS you want. With a rollup, you can
compress most activity to ~10-20 bytes per transaction, so 1 kB/sec
gives you 50-100 TPS, 1 MB/sec gives you 50,000-100,000 TPS, and so
forth. Fortunately, internet bandwidth <a
href="http://www.circleid.com/posts/20191119_nielsens_law_of_internet_bandwidth/">continues
to grow quickly</a>, and does not seem to be slowing down the way
Moore's law for computation is, so increasing scaling for data without
increasing computational load is quite a viable path for blockchains to
take!</p>
<p>Note also that it is not just data capacity that matters, it is also
data latency (ie. having low block times). Layer 2 protocols like rollup
(or for that matter Plasma) only give any guarantees of security when
the data actually is published to chain; hence, the time it takes for
data to be reliably included (ideally "finalized") on chain is the time
that it takes between when Alice sends Bob a payment and Bob can be
confident that this payment will be included. The block time of the base
layer sets the latency for anything whose confirmation depends things
being included in the base layer. This could be worked around with
on-chain security deposits, aka "bonds", at the cost of high capital
inefficiency, but such an approach is inherently imperfect because a
malicious actor could trick an unlimited number of different people by
sacrificing one deposit.</p>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>"Keep layer 1 simple, make up for it on layer 2" is NOT a universal
answer to blockchain scalability and functionality problems, because it
fails to take into account that layer 1 blockchains themselves must have
a sufficient level of scalability and functionality for this "building
on top" to actually be possible (unless your so-called "layer 2
protocols" are just trusted intermediaries). However, it is true that
beyond a certain point, any layer 1 functionality <em>can</em> be
replicated on layer 2, and in many cases it's a good idea to do this to
improve upgradeability. Hence, we need <a
href="../../../2018/08/26/layer_1.html">layer 1 development in parallel
with layer 2 development in the short term, and more focus on layer 2 in
the long term</a>.</p>
