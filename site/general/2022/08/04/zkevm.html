<title> The different types of ZK-EVMs </title>

<p><em>Special thanks to the PSE, Polygon Hermez, Zksync, Scroll, Matter
Labs and Starkware teams for discussion and review.</em></p>
<p>There have been many "ZK-EVM" projects making flashy announcements
recently. <a
href="https://blog.polygon.technology/the-future-is-now-for-ethereum-scaling-introducing-polygon-zkevm">Polygon</a>
open-sourced their ZK-EVM project, <a
href="https://matterlabs.medium.com/100-days-to-mainnet-6f230893bd73">ZKSync</a>
released their plans for ZKSync 2.0, and the relative newcomer <a
href="https://mirror.xyz/scroll.eth/XQyXDgyxoefag6hcBgGJFz8qrb10rmSU-zUBvY3Q9_A">Scroll</a>
announced their ZK-EVM recently. There is also the ongoing effort from
the <a
href="https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zkevm-circuits">Privacy
and Scaling Explorations team</a>, <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/a-zk-evm-specification/11549">Nicolas
Liochon et al's team</a>, an <a
href="https://medium.com/starkware/starknet-alpha-2-4aa116f0ecfc">alpha
compiler</a> from the EVM to Starkware's ZK-friendly language <a
href="https://starkware.co/cairo/">Cairo</a>, and certainly at least a
few others I have missed.</p>
<p>The core goal of all of these projects is the same: to use <a
href="../../../2021/01/26/snarks.html">ZK-SNARK</a> technology to make
cryptographic proofs of execution of Ethereum-like transactions, either
to make it much easier to verify the Ethereum chain itself or to build
<a href="../../../2021/01/05/rollup.html">ZK-rollups</a> that are (close
to) equivalent to what Ethereum provides but are much more scalable. But
there are subtle differences between these projects, and what tradeoffs
they are making between practicality and speed. This post will attempt
to describe a taxonomy of different "types" of EVM equivalence, and what
are the benefits and costs of trying to achieve each type.</p>
<h2 id="overview-in-chart-form">Overview (in chart form)</h2>
<p><img src="../../../../images/zkevm/chart.png" /></p>
<h2 id="type-1-fully-ethereum-equivalent">Type 1 (fully
Ethereum-equivalent)</h2>
<p>Type 1 ZK-EVMs strive to be fully and uncompromisingly
Ethereum-equivalent. They do not change any part of the Ethereum system
to make it easier to generate proofs. They do not replace hashes, state
trees, transaction trees, precompiles or any other in-consensus logic,
no matter how peripheral.</p>
<h4 id="advantage-perfect-compatibility"><span
style="color:#008800">Advantage: perfect compatibility</span></h4>
<p>The goal is to be able to verify Ethereum blocks as they are today -
or at least, verify the <a
href="https://hackmd.io/@n0ble/the-merge-terminology">execution-layer
side</a> (so, beacon chain consensus logic is not included, but all the
transaction execution and smart contract and account logic is
included).</p>
<p>Type 1 ZK-EVMs are what we ultimately need make the Ethereum layer 1
itself more scalable. In the long term, modifications to Ethereum tested
out in Type 2 or Type 3 ZK-EVMs might be introduced into Ethereum
proper, but such a re-architecting comes with its own complexities.</p>
<p>Type 1 ZK-EVMs are also ideal for rollups, because they allow rollups
to re-use a lot of infrastructure. For example, Ethereum execution
clients can be used as-is to generate and process rollup blocks (or at
least, they can be once <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/capella/beacon-chain.md">withdrawals
are implemented</a> and that functionality can be re-used to support ETH
being deposited into the rollup), so tooling such as block explorers,
block production, etc is very easy to re-use.</p>
<h4 id="disadvantage-prover-time"><span
style="color:#cc0000">Disadvantage: prover time</span></h4>
<p>Ethereum was not originally designed around ZK-friendliness, so there
are <em>many</em> parts of the Ethereum protocol that take a large
amount of computation to ZK-prove. Type 1 aims to replicate Ethereum
exactly, and so it has no way of mitigating these inefficiencies. At
present, proofs for Ethereum blocks take many hours to produce. This can
be mitigated either by clever engineering to massively parallelize the
prover or in the longer term by ZK-SNARK ASICs.</p>
<h4 id="whos-building-it"><span style="color:#880088">Who's building
it?</span></h4>
<p>The <a
href="https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zkevm-specs">ZK-EVM
Community Edition</a> (bootstrapped by community contributors including
<a href="https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/">Privacy and
Scaling Explorations</a>, the Scroll team, <a
href="https://taiko.xyz/">Taiko</a> and others) is a Tier 1 ZK-EVM.</p>
<h2 id="type-2-fully-evm-equivalent">Type 2 (fully EVM-equivalent)</h2>
<p>Type 2 ZK-EVMs strive to be exactly EVM-equivalent, but not quite
Ethereum-equivalent. That is, they look exactly like Ethereum "from
within", but they have some differences on the outside, particularly in
data structures like the block structure and <a
href="https://medium.com/@eiki1212/ethereum-state-trie-architecture-explained-a30237009d4e">state
tree</a>.</p>
<p>The goal is to be fully compatible with existing applications, but
make some minor modifications to Ethereum to make development easier and
to make proof generation faster.</p>
<h4 id="advantage-perfect-equivalence-at-the-vm-level"><span
style="color:#008800">Advantage: perfect equivalence at the VM
level</span></h4>
<p>Type 2 ZK-EVMs make changes to data structures that hold things like
the Ethereum state. Fortunately, these are structures that the EVM
itself cannot access directly, and so applications that work on Ethereum
would almost always still work on a Type 2 ZK-EVM rollup. You would not
be able to use Ethereum execution clients as-is, but you could use them
with some modifications, and you would still be able to use EVM
debugging tools and most other developer infrastructure.</p>
<p>There are a small number of exceptions. One incompatibility arises
for applications that verify Merkle proofs of <a
href="https://github.com/aragon/evm-storage-proofs">historical Ethereum
blocks</a> to verify claims about historical transactions, receipts or
state (eg. bridges sometimes do this). A ZK-EVM that replaces Keccak
with a different hash function would break these proofs. However, I
usually recommend against building applications this way anyway, because
future Ethereum changes (eg. <a
href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/verkle_tree_eip">Verkle
trees</a>) will break such applications even on Ethereum itself. A
better alternative would be for Ethereum itself to add <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/future-proof-shard-and-history-access-precompiles/9781">future-proof
history access precompiles</a>.</p>
<h4 id="disadvantage-improved-but-still-slow-prover-time"><span
style="color:#cc0000">Disadvantage: improved but still slow prover
time</span></h4>
<p>Type 2 ZK-EVMs provide faster prover times than Type 1 mainly by
removing parts of the Ethereum stack that rely on needlessly complicated
and ZK-unfriendly cryptography. Particularly, they might change
Ethereum's Keccak and RLP-based Merkle Patricia tree and perhaps the
block and receipt structures. Type 2 ZK-EVMs might instead use a
different hash function, eg. <a
href="https://www.poseidon-hash.info/">Poseidon</a>. Another natural
modification is modifying the state tree to store the code hash and
keccak, removing the need to verify hashes to process the
<code>EXTCODEHASH</code> and <code>EXTCODECOPY</code> opcodes.</p>
<p>These modifications significantly improve prover times, but they do
not solve every problem. The slowness from having to prove the EVM
as-is, with all of the inefficiencies and ZK-unfriendliness inherent to
the EVM, still remains. One simple example of this is memory: because an
<code>MLOAD</code> can read any 32 bytes, including "unaligned" chunks
(where the start and end are not multiples of 32), an MLOAD can't simply
be interpreted as reading one chunk; rather, it might require reading
two consecutive chunks and performing bit operations to combine the
result.</p>
<h4 id="whos-building-it-1"><span style="color:#880088">Who's building
it?</span></h4>
<p><a
href="https://mirror.xyz/scroll.eth/XQyXDgyxoefag6hcBgGJFz8qrb10rmSU-zUBvY3Q9_A">Scroll's
ZK-EVM</a> project is building toward a Type 2 ZK-EVM, as is <a
href="https://blog.polygon.technology/the-future-is-now-for-ethereum-scaling-introducing-polygon-zkevm">Polygon
Hermez</a>. That said, neither project is quite there yet; in
particular, a lot of the more complicated precompiles have not yet been
implemented. Hence, at the moment both projects are better considered <a
href="#type-3-almost-evm-equivalent">Type 3</a>.</p>
<h2 id="type-2.5-evm-equivalent-except-for-gas-costs">Type 2.5
(EVM-equivalent, except for gas costs)</h2>
<p>One way to <span style="color:#008800">significantly improve
worst-case prover times</span> is to greatly increase the gas costs of
specific operations in the EVM that are very difficult to ZK-prove. This
might involve precompiles, the KECCAK opcode, and possibly specific
patterns of calling contracts or accessing memory or storage or
reverting.</p>
<p>Changing gas costs <span style="color:#cc0000">may reduce developer
tooling compatibility and break a few applications</span>, but it's
generally considered less risky than "deeper" EVM changes. Developers
should take care to not require more gas in a transaction than fits into
a block, to never make calls with hard-coded amounts of gas (this has
already been standard advice for developers for a long time).</p>
<p>An alternative way to manage resource constraints is to simply set
hard limits on the number of times each operation can be called. This is
easier to implement in circuits, but plays much less nicely with EVM
security assumptions. I would call this approach Type 3 rather than Type
2.5.</p>
<h2 id="type-3-almost-evm-equivalent">Type 3 (almost
EVM-equivalent)</h2>
<p>Type 3 ZK-EVMs are <em>almost</em> EVM-equivalent, but make a few
sacrifices to exact equivalence to further improve prover times and make
the EVM easier to develop.</p>
<h4 id="advantage-easier-to-build-and-faster-prover-times"><span
style="color:#008800">Advantage: easier to build, and faster prover
times</span></h4>
<p>Type 3 ZK-EVMs might remove a few features that are exceptionally
hard to implement in a ZK-EVM implementation. <a
href="https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/build/canonical-contracts/precompiles/eth-mainnet/">Precompiles</a>
are often at the top of the list here;. Additionally, Type 3 ZK-EVMs
sometimes also have minor differences in how they treat contract code,
memory or stack.</p>
<h4 id="disadvantage-more-incompatibility"><span
style="color:#cc0000">Disadvantage: more incompatibility</span></h4>
<p>The goal of a Type 3 ZK-EVM is to be compatible with <em>most</em>
applications, and require only minimal re-writing for the rest. That
said, there will be some applications that would need to be rewritten
either because they use pre-compiles that the Type 3 ZK-EVM removes or
because of subtle dependencies on edge cases that the VMs treat
differently.</p>
<h4 id="whos-building-it-2"><span style="color:#880088">Who's building
it?</span></h4>
<p>Scroll and Polygon are both Type 3 in their current forms, though
they're expected to improve compatibility over time. Polygon has a
unique design where they are ZK-verifying their own internal language
called <a
href="https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-doc/blob/main/mkdocs/docs/zkEVM/zkASM/Introduction.md">zkASM</a>,
and they interpret ZK-EVM code using the zkASM implementation. Despite
this implementation detail, I would still call this a genuine Type 3
ZK-EVM; it can still verify EVM code, it just uses some different
internal logic to do it.</p>
<p>Today, no ZK-EVM team <em>wants</em> to be a Type 3; Type 3 is simply
a transitional stage until the complicated work of adding precompiles is
finished and the project can move to Type 2.5. In the future, however,
Type 1 or Type 2 ZK-EVMs may become Type 3 ZK-EVMs voluntarily, by
adding in <em>new</em> ZK-SNARK-friendly precompiles that provide
functionality for developers with low prover times and gas costs.</p>
<h2 id="type-4-high-level-language-equivalent">Type 4
(high-level-language equivalent)</h2>
<p>A Type 4 system works by taking smart contract source code written in
a high-level language (eg. <a
href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/">Solidity</a>, <a
href="https://vyper.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Vyper</a>, or some
intermediate that both compile to) and compiling <em>that</em> to some
language that is explicitly designed to be ZK-SNARK-friendly.</p>
<h4 id="advantage-very-fast-prover-times"><span
style="color:#008800">Advantage: very fast prover times</span></h4>
<p>There is a <em>lot</em> of overhead that you can avoid by not
ZK-proving all the different parts of each EVM execution step, and
starting from the higher-level code directly.</p>
<p>I'm only describing this advantage with one sentence in this post
(compared to a big bullet point list below for compatibility-related
disadvantages), but that should not be interpreted as a value judgement!
Compiling from high-level languages directly really can greatly reduce
costs and help decentralization by making it easier to be a prover.</p>
<h4 id="disadvantage-more-incompatibility-1"><span
style="color:#cc0000">Disadvantage: more incompatibility</span></h4>
<p>A "normal" application written in Vyper or Solidity can be compiled
down and it would "just work", but there are some important ways in
which very many applications are not "normal":</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contracts may not have the same addresses</strong> in a Type
4 system as they do in the EVM, because CREATE2 contract addresses
depend on the exact bytecode. This breaks applications that rely on
not-yet-deployed "counterfactual contracts", ERC-4337 wallets, <a
href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2470">EIP-2470 singletons</a>
and many other applications.</li>
<li><strong>Handwritten EVM bytecode</strong> is more difficult to use.
Many applications use handwritten EVM bytecode in some parts for
efficiency. Type 4 systems may not support it, though there are ways to
implement limited EVM bytecode support to satisfy these use cases
without going through the effort of becoming a full-on Type 3
ZK-EVM.</li>
<li><strong>Lots of debugging infrastructure cannot be carried
over</strong>, because such infrastructure runs over the EVM bytecode.
That said, this disadvantage is mitigated by the <em>greater</em> access
to debugging infrastructure from "traditional" high-level or
intermediate languages (eg. LLVM).</li>
</ul>
<p>Developers should be mindful of these issues.</p>
<h4 id="whos-building-it-3"><span style="color:#880088">Who's building
it?</span></h4>
<p><a
href="https://matterlabs.medium.com/100-days-to-mainnet-6f230893bd73">ZKSync</a>
is a Type 4 system, though it may add compatibility for EVM bytecode
over time. Nethermind's <a
href="https://github.com/NethermindEth/warp">Warp</a> project is
building a compiler from Solidity to Starkware's Cairo, which will turn
StarkNet into a de-facto Type 4 system.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-zk-evm-types">The future of ZK-EVM types</h2>
<p>The types are not unambiguously "better" or "worse" than other types.
Rather, they are different points on the tradeoff space: lower-numbered
types are more compatible with existing infrastructure but slower, and
higher-numbered types are less compatible with existing infrastructure
but faster. In general, it's healthy for the space that all of these
types are being explored.</p>
<p>Additionally, ZK-EVM projects can easily start at higher-numbered
types and jump to lower-numbered types (or vice versa) over time. For
example:</p>
<ul>
<li>A ZK-EVM could start as Type 3, deciding not to include some
features that are especially hard to ZK-prove. Later, they can add those
features over time, and move to Type 2.</li>
<li>A ZK-EVM could start as Type 2, and later become a hybrid Type 2 /
Type 1 ZK-EVM, by providing the possibility of operating either in full
Ethereum compatibility mode or with a modified state tree that can be
proven faster. Scroll is considering moving in this direction.</li>
<li>What starts off as a Type 4 system could become Type 3 over time by
adding the ability to process EVM code later on (though developers would
still be encouraged to compile direct from high-level languages to
reduce fees and prover times)</li>
<li>A Type 2 or Type 3 ZK-EVM can become a Type 1 ZK-EVM if Ethereum
itself adopts its modifications in an effort to become more
ZK-friendly.</li>
<li>A Type 1 or Type 2 ZK-EVM can become a Type 3 ZK-EVM by adding a
precompile for verifying code in a very ZK-SNARK-friendly language. This
would give developers a choice between Ethereum compatibility and speed.
This would be Type 3, because it breaks perfect EVM equivalence, but for
practical intents and purposes it would have a lot of the benefits of
Type 1 and 2. The main downside might be that some developer tooling
would not understand the ZK-EVM's custom precompiles, though this could
be fixed: developer tools could add universal precompile support by
supporting a config format that includes an EVM code equivalent
implementation of the precompile.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, my hope is that everything becomes Type 1 over time,
through a combination of improvements in ZK-EVMs and improvements to
Ethereum itself to make it more ZK-SNARK-friendly. In such a future, we
would have multiple ZK-EVM implementations which could be used both for
ZK rollups and to verify the Ethereum chain itself. Theoretically, there
is no need for Ethereum to standardize on a single ZK-EVM implementation
for L1 use; different clients could use different proofs, so we continue
to benefit from code redundancy.</p>
<p>However, it is going to take quite some time until we get to such a
future. In the meantime, we are going to see a lot of innovation in the
different paths to scaling Ethereum and Ethereum-based ZK-rollups.</p>
