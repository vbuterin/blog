<p>The recent LUNA crash, which led to tens of billions of dollars of
losses, has led to a <a
href="https://rollcall.com/2022/05/03/critics-see-risk-in-algorithmic-stablecoins/">storm</a>
of <a
href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/algorithmic-stablecoins-what-they-are-and-how-they-can-go-terribly-wrong/">criticism</a>
of "<a

stablecoins</a>" as a <a

with many <a
href="(https://twitter.com/satofishi/status/1525394442118647810)">considering</a>
them to be a "<a
href="https://twitter.com/jp_koning/status/1524343011639013381">fundamentally
flawed product</a>". The greater level of scrutiny on defi financial
mechanisms, especially those that try very hard to optimize for "capital
efficiency", is highly welcome. The greater acknowledgement that present
performance is no guarantee of future returns (or even future
lack-of-total-collapse) is even more welcome. Where the sentiment goes
very wrong, however, is in painting all automated pure-crypto
stablecoins with the same brush, and dismissing the entire category.</p>
<p>While there are plenty of automated stablecoin designs that are
fundamentally flawed and doomed to collapse eventually, and plenty more
that can survive theoretically but are highly risky, there are also many
stablecoins that are highly robust in theory, and have survived <a
href="https://blog.makerdao.com/the-market-collapse-of-march-12-2020-how-it-impacted-makerdao/">extreme
tests of crypto market conditions</a> in practice. Hence, what we need
is not stablecoin boosterism <em>or</em> stablecoin doomerism, but
rather a return to <em>principles-based thinking</em>. So what
<em>are</em> some good principles for evaluating whether or not a
particular automated stablecoin is a truly stable one? For me, the test
that I start from is asking how the stablecoin responds to two thought
experiments.</p>
<p><em>Click <a href="#analysis">here</a> to skip straight to the
thought experiments.</em></p>
<h2 id="reminder-what-is-an-automated-stablecoin">Reminder: what is an
automated stablecoin?</h2>
<p>For the purposes of this post, an automated stablecoin is a system
that has the following properties:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It issues a <strong>stablecoin</strong>, which attempts to
<strong>target</strong> a particular <strong>price index</strong>.
Usually, the target is 1 USD, but there are other options too. There is
some <strong>targeting mechanism</strong> that continuously works to
push the price toward the index if it veers away in either direction.
This makes ETH and BTC not stablecoins (duh).</li>
<li>The targeting mechanism is <strong>completely
decentralized</strong>, and free of protocol-level dependencies on
specific trusted actors. Particularly, it must <strong>not rely on asset
custodians</strong>. This makes USDT and USDC not automated
stablecoins.</li>
</ol>
<p>In practice, (2) means that the targeting mechanism must be some kind
of smart contract which manages some reserve of crypto-assets, and uses
those crypto-assets to prop up the price if it drops.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-terra-work">How does Terra work?</h2>
<p><a
href="https://docs.terra.money/docs/learn/protocol.html">Terra-style
stablecoins</a> (roughly the same family as <a
href="https://blog.bitmex.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/A-Note-on-Cryptocurrency-Stabilisation-Seigniorage-Shares.pdf">seignorage
shares</a>, though many implementation details differ) work by having a
pair of two coins, which we'll call a <em>stablecoin</em> and a
<em>volatile-coin</em> or <em>volcoin</em> (in Terra, UST is the
stablecoin and LUNA is the volcoin). The stablecoin retains stability
using a simple mechanism:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the price of the stablecoin exceeds the target, the system
auctions off new stablecoins (and uses the revenue to burn volcoins)
until the price returns to the target</li>
<li>If the price of the stablecoin drops below the target, the system
buys back and burns stablecoins (issuing new volcoins to fund the burn)
until the price returns to the target</li>
</ul>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/stable-files/stablecoin.drawio.png"
class="padded" /></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now what is the price of the volcoin? The volcoin's value could be
purely speculative, backed by an assumption of greater stablecoin demand
in the future (which would require burning volcoins to issue).
Alternatively, the value could come from fees: either trading fees on
stablecoin &lt;-&gt; volcoin exchange, or holding fees charged per year
to stablecoin holders, or both. But in all cases, <strong>the price of
the volcoin comes from the expectation of future activity in the
system</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-rai-work">How does RAI work?</h2>
<p>In this post I'm focusing on RAI rather than DAI because RAI better
exemplifies the pure "ideal type" of a collateralized automated
stablecoin, backed by ETH only. DAI is a hybrid system backed by both
centralized and decentralized collateral, which is a reasonable choice
for their product but it does make analysis trickier.</p>
<p>In RAI, there are two main categories of participants (there's also
holders of FLX, the speculative token, but they play a less important
role):</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>RAI holder</strong> holds RAI, the stablecoin of the RAI
system.</li>
<li>A <strong>RAI lender</strong> deposits some ETH into a smart
contract object called a "<strong>safe</strong>". They can then withdraw
RAI up to the value of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{3}\)</span>
of that ETH (eg. if 1 ETH = 100 RAI, then if you deposit 10 ETH you can
withdraw up to <span class="math inline">\(10 * 100 * \frac{2}{3}
\approx 667\)</span> RAI). A lender can recover the ETH in the same if
they pay back their RAI debt.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two main reasons to become a RAI lender:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>To go long on ETH</strong>: if you deposit 10 ETH and
withdraw 500 RAI in the above example, you end up with a position worth
500 RAI but with 10 ETH of exposure, so it goes up/down by 2% for every
1% change in the ETH price.</li>
<li><strong>Arbitrage</strong> if you find a fiat-denominated investment
that goes up faster than RAI, you can borrow RAI, put the funds into
that investment, and earn a profit on the difference.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the ETH price drops, and a safe no longer has enough collateral
(meaning, the RAI debt is now more than <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{3}\)</span> times the value of the ETH
deposited), a <strong>liquidation</strong> event takes place. The safe
gets auctioned off for anyone else to buy by putting up more
collateral.</p>
<p>The other main mechanism to understand is <strong>redemption rate
adjustment</strong>. In RAI, the target isn't a fixed quantity of USD;
instead, it moves up or down, and the rate at which it moves up or down
adjusts in response to market conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If the price of RAI is above the target, the redemption rate
decreases</strong>, reducing the incentive to hold RAI and increasing
the incentive to hold negative RAI by being a lender. This pushes the
price back down.</li>
<li><strong>If the price of RAI is below the target, the redemption rate
increases</strong>, increasing the incentive to hold RAI and reducing
the incentive to hold negative RAI by being a lender. This pushes the
price back up.</li>
</ul>

<h2
id="thought-experiment-1-can-the-stablecoin-even-in-theory-safely-wind-down-to-zero-users">Thought
experiment 1: can the stablecoin, even in theory, safely "wind down" to
zero users?</h2>
<p>In the non-crypto real world, nothing lasts forever. Companies shut
down all the time, either because they never manage to find enough users
in the first place, or because once-strong demand for their product is
no longer there, or because they get displaced by a superior competitor.
Sometimes, there are partial collapses, declines from mainstream status
to niche status (eg. MySpace). Such things have to happen to make room
for new products. But in the non-crypto world, when a product shuts down
or declines, <em>customers</em> generally don't get hurt all that much.
There are certainly some cases of people falling through the cracks, but
on the whole shutdowns are orderly and the problem is manageable.</p>
<p>But what about automated stablecoins? What happens if we look at a
stablecoin from the bold and radical perspective that the system's
ability to avoid collapsing and losing huge amounts of user funds should
<em>not</em> depend on a constant influx of new users? Let's see and
find out!</p>
<h3 id="can-terra-wind-down">Can Terra wind down?</h3>
<p>In Terra, the price of the volcoin (LUNA) comes from the expectation
of fees from future activity in the system. <strong>So what happens if
expected future activity drops to near-zero</strong>? The market cap of
the volcoin drops until it becomes quite small relative to the
stablecoin. At that point, <strong>the system becomes extremely
fragile</strong>: only a small downward shock to demand for the
stablecoin could lead to the targeting mechanism printing lots of
volcoins, which causes the volcoin to hyperinflate, at which point the
stablecoin too loses its value.</p>
<p><strong>The system's collapse can even become a self-fulfilling
prophecy</strong>: if it seems like a collapse is likely, this reduces
the expectation of future fees that is the basis of the value of the
volcoin, pushing the volcoin's market cap down, making the system even
more fragile and potentially triggering that very collapse - exactly as
we saw happen with Terra in May.</p>

<p><em>First, the volcoin price drops. Then, the stablecoin starts to
shake. The system attempts to shore up stablecoin demand by issuing more
volcoins. With confidence in the system low, there are few buyers, so
the volcoin price rapidly falls. Finally, once the volcoin price is
near-zero, the stablecoin too collapses.</em></p>
</small>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>In principle, if demand decreases extremely slowly, the volcoin's
expected future fees and hence its market cap could still be large
relative to the stablecoin, and so the system would continue to be
stable at every step of its decline. <strong>But this kind of successful
slowly-decreasing managed decline is very unlikely. What's more likely
is a rapid drop in interest followed by a bang.</strong></p>

</center>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="can-rai-wind-down">Can RAI wind down?</h3>
<p><strong>RAI's security depends on an asset external to the RAI system
(ETH), so RAI has a much easier time safely winding down</strong>. If
the decline in demand is unbalanced (so, either demand for holding drops
faster or demand for lending drops faster), the redemption rate will
adjust to equalize the two. The lenders are holding a leveraged position
in ETH, not FLX, so there's no risk of a positive-feedback loop where
reduced confidence in RAI causes demand for lending to also
decrease.</p>
<p>If, in the extreme case, all demand for holding RAI disappears
simultaneously except for one holder, the redemption rate would
skyrocket until eventually every lender's safe gets liquidated. The
single remaining holder would be able to buy the safe in the liquidation
auction, use their RAI to immediately clear its debt, and withdraw the
ETH. This gives them the opportunity to get a fair price for their RAI,
paid for out of the ETH in the safe.</p>
<p>Another extreme case worth examining is where RAI becomes the
<em>primary</em> appliation on Ethereum. In this case, a reduction in
expected future demand for RAI would crater the price of ETH. In the
extreme case, a cascade of liquidations is possible, leading to a messy
collapse of the system. But RAI is far more robust against this
possibility than a Terra-style system.</p>
<h2
id="thought-experiment-2-what-happens-if-you-try-to-peg-the-stablecoin-to-an-index-that-goes-up-20-per-year">Thought
experiment 2: what happens if you try to peg the stablecoin to an index
that goes up 20% per year?</h2>
<p>Currently, stablecoins tend to be pegged to the US dollar. RAI stands
out as a slight exception, because its peg adjusts up or down due to the
redemption rate and the peg started at 3.14 USD instead of 1 USD (the
exact starting value was a concession to being normie-friendly, as a
true math nerd would have chosen <a href="https://tauday.com/">tau =
6.28</a> USD instead). But they do not have to be. You can have a
stablecoin pegged to a basket of assets, a consumer price index, or some
arbitrarily complex formula ("a quantity of value sufficient to buy
{global average CO2 concentration minus 375} hectares of land in the
forests of Yakutia"). As long as you can find an oracle to prove the
index, and people to participate on all sides of the market, you can
make such a stablecoin work.</p>
<p>As a thought experiment to evaluate sustainability, let's imagine a
stablecoin with a particular index: a quantity of US dollars that grows
by 20% per year. In math language, the index is <span
class="math inline">\(1.2^{(t - t_0)}\)</span> USD, where <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is the current time in years and <span
class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> is the time when the system launched.
An even more fun alternative is <span
class="math inline">\(1.04^{\frac{1}{2}*(t - t_0)^2}\)</span> USD, so it
starts off acting like a regular USD-denominated stablecoin, but the
USD-denominated return rate keeps increasing by 4% every year.</p>
<center>
<table class="transparent">
<tr>
<p><img src="../../../../images/stable-files/ponzi1.png" /></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><img src="../../../../images/stable-files/ponzi2.png" /></p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>Obviously, there is no genuine investment that can get anywhere close
to 20% returns per year, and there is <em>definitely</em> no genuine
investment that can keep increasing its return rate by 4% per year
forever. <em>But what happens if you try</em>?</p>
<p>I will claim that there's <em>basically</em> two ways for a
stablecoin that tries to track such an index to turn out:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It charges some kind of negative interest rate on holders that
equilibrates to basically cancel out the USD-denominated growth rate
built in to the index.</li>
<li>It turns into a Ponzi, giving stablecoin holders amazing returns for
some time until one day it suddenly collapses with a bang.</li>
</ol>
<p>It should be pretty easy to understand why RAI does (1) and LUNA does
(2), and so RAI is better than LUNA. But this also shows a deeper and
more important fact about stablecoins: <strong>for a collateralized
automated stablecoin to be sustainable, it has to <em>somehow</em>
contain the possibility of implementing a negative interest
rate.</strong> A version of RAI programmatically prevented from
implementing negative interest rates (which is what the earlier <a
href="https://github.com/makerdao/sai/blob/master/DEVELOPING.md">single-collateral
DAI</a> basically was) would also turn into a Ponzi if tethered to a
rapidly-appreciating price index.</p>
<p>Even outside of crazy hypotheticals where you build a stablecoin to
track a Ponzi index, the stablecoin must <em>somehow</em> be able to
respond to situations where even at a zero interest rate, demand for
holding exceeds demand for borrowing. If you don't, the price rises
above the peg, and the stablecoin becomes vulnerable to price movements
in both directions that are quite unpredictable.</p>
<p>Negative interest rates can be done in two ways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>RAI-style, having a floating target that can drop over time if the
redemption rate is negative</li>
<li>Actually having balances decrease over time</li>
</ol>
<p>Option (1) has the user-experience flaw that the stablecoin no longer
cleanly tracks "1 USD". Option (2) has the developer-experience flaw
that developers aren't used to dealing with assets where receiving N
coins does not unconditionally mean that you can later send N coins. But
choosing one of the two seems unavoidable - unless you go the MakerDAO
route of being a <em>hybrid</em> stablecoin that uses both pure
cryptoassets and centralized assets like USDC as collateral.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-we-learn">What can we learn?</h2>
<p>In general, the crypto space needs to move away from the attitude
that it's okay to achieve safety by relying on endless growth. It's
certainly not acceptable to maintain that attitude by saying that "the
fiat world works in the same way", because the fiat world is not
attempting to offer anyone returns that go up much faster than the
regular economy, outside of isolated cases that certainly should be
criticized with the same ferocity.</p>
<p>Instead, while we certainly should hope for growth, we should
evaluate how safe systems are by looking at their steady state, and even
the pessimistic state of how they would fare under extreme conditions
and ultimately whether or not they can safely wind down. If a system
passes this test, that does not mean it's safe; it could still be
fragile for other reasons (eg. insufficient collateral ratios), or have
bugs or <a href="../../../2021/08/16/voting3.html">governance
vulnerabilities</a>. But steady-state and extreme-case soundness should
always be one of the first things that we check for.</p>
