<title> What do I think about network states? </title>

<p>On July 4, Balaji Srinivasan released <a
href="https://thenetworkstate.com/">the first version of his
long-awaited new book</a> describing his vision for "<strong>network
states</strong>": communities organized around a particular vision of
how to run their own society that start off as online clubs, but then
build up more and more of a presence over time and eventually become
large enough to seek political autonomy or even diplomatic
recognition.</p>
<p>Network states can be viewed as an attempt at an ideological
successor to libertarianism: Balaji repeatedly praises <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Sovereign-Individual-Mastering-Transition-Information/dp/0684832720">The
Sovereign Individual</a> (see my mini-review <a
href="https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1244353457034854400">here</a>)
as important reading and inspiration, but also departs from its thinking
in key ways, centering in his new work many non-individualistic and
non-monetary aspects of social relations like morals and community.
Network states can also be viewed as an attempt to sketch out a possible
broader political narrative for the crypto space. Rather than staying in
their own corner of the internet disconnected from the wider world,
blockchains could serve as a centerpiece for a new way of organizing
large chunks of human society.</p>
<p>These are high promises. Can network states live up to them? Do
network states actually provide enough benefits to be worth getting
excited about? Regardless of the merits of network states, does it
actually make sense to tie the idea together with blockchains and
cryptocurrency? And on the other hand, is there anything crucially
important that this vision of the world misses? This post represents my
attempt to try to understand these questions.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-network-state">What is a network state?</h2>
<p>Balaji helpfully gives multiple short definitions of what a network
state is. First, his definition in one sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A network state is a highly aligned online community with a capacity
for collective action that crowdfunds territory around the world and
eventually gains diplomatic recognition from pre-existing states.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This so far seems uncontroversial. Create a new internet community
online, once it grows big enough materialize it offline, and eventually
try to negotiate for some kind of status. Someone of almost <em>any</em>
political ideology could find <em>some</em> form of network state under
this definition that they could get behind. But now, we get to his
definition in a <em>longer</em> sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A network state is a social network with a moral innovation, a sense
of national consciousness, a recognized founder, a capacity for
collective action, an in-person level of civility, an integrated
cryptocurrency, a consensual government limited by a social smart
contract, an archipelago of crowdfunded physical territories, a virtual
capital, and an on-chain census that proves a large enough population,
income, and real-estate footprint to attain a measure of diplomatic
recognition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, the concept starts to get opinionated: we're not just talking
about the general concept of online communities that have collective
agency and eventually try to materialize on land, we're talking about a
<em>specific Balajian vision</em> of what network states should look
like. It's completely possible to support network states in general, but
have disagreements with the Balajian view of what properties network
states should have. If you're not already a "crypto convert", it's hard
to see why an "integrated cryptocurrency" is such a fundamental part of
the network state concept, for example - though Balaji does later on in
the book defend his choices.</p>
<p>Finally, Balaji expands on this conception of a Balajian network
state in longer-form, first in <a
href="https://thenetworkstate.com/the-network-state-in-one-thousand-words">"a
thousand words"</a> (apparently, Balajian network states use <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octal">base 8</a>, as the actual
word count is exactly <span class="math inline">\(512 = 8^3\)</span>)
and then <a
href="https://thenetworkstate.com/the-network-state-in-one-essay">an
essay</a>, and at the very end of the book <a
href="https://thenetworkstate.com/on-network-states">a whole
chapter</a>.</p>

<p><small><i>And, of course,
<a href="https://thenetworkstate.com/the-network-state-in-one-image">an
image</a>.</i></small></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>One key point that Balaji stresses across many <a
href="https://thenetworkstate.com/the-one-commandment">chapters</a> and
<a href="https://thenetworkstate.com/prologue">pages</a> is the
unavoidable <em>moral</em> ingredient required for any successful new
community. As Balaji writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The quick answer comes from Paul Johnson at the 11:00 mark of <a
href="https://charlierose.com/videos/2242">this talk</a>, where he notes
that early America's religious colonies succeeded at a higher rate than
its for-profit colonies, because the former had a purpose. The slightly
longer answer is that in a startup society, you're not asking people to
buy a product (which is an economic, individualistic pitch) but to join
a community (which is a cultural, collective pitch).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a
href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1069397103037002003">commitment
paradox of religious communes</a> is key here: counterintuitively, it's
the religious communes that <em>demand the most</em> of their members
that are the most long-lasting.</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/networkstates/communes.png"
class="padded" /></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>This is where Balajism explicitly diverges from the more traditional
neoliberal-capitalist ideal of the defanged, apolitical and passion-free
consumerist <a
href="https://www.the-american-interest.com/2019/05/03/the-last-man-and-the-future-of-history/">"last
man"</a>. Unlike the strawman libertarian, Balaji does not believe that
everything can "merely be a consumer product". Rather, he stresses
greatly the importance of social norms for cohesion, and a literally
religious attachment to the values that make a particular network state
distinct from the world outside. As Balaji says <a
href="https://www.ivoox.com/en/balaji-srinivasan-and-the-8216-network-state-8217-audios-mp3_rf_89496974_1.html">in
this podcast</a> at 18:20, most current libertarian attempts at
micronations are like "Zionism without Judaism", and this is a key part
of why they fail.</p>
<p>This recognition is not a new one. Indeed, it's at the core of
Antonio Garcia Martinez's criticism of Balaji's earlier
sovereign-individual ideas (see <a
href="https://www.ivoox.com/en/balaji-srinivasan-on-the-metaverse-audios-mp3_rf_83588311_1.html">this
podcast at ~27:00</a>), praising the tenacity of Cuban exiles in Miami
who "perhaps irrationally, said this is our new homeland, this is our
last stand". And in Fukuyama's <em>The End of History</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This city, like any city, has foreign enemies and needs to be
defended from outside attack. It therefore needs a class of guardians
who are courageous and public-spirited, who are willing to sacrifice
their material desires and wants for the sake of the common good.
Socrates does not believe that courage and public-spiritedness can arise
out of a calculation of enlightened self-interest. Rather, they must be
rooted in thymos, in the just pride of the guardian class in themselves
and in their own city, and their potentially irrational anger against
those who threaten it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Balaji's argument in <em>The Network State</em>, as I am
interpreting it, is as follows. While we do need political collectives
bound not just by economic interest but also by moral force, we don't
need to stick with <em>the specific political collectives we have
today</em>, which are highly flawed and increasingly unrepresentative of
people's values. Rather, we can, and should, create new and better
collectives - and his <a
href="https://thenetworkstate.com/the-network-state-in-one-thousand-words">seven-step
program</a> tells us how.</strong></p>
<h2 id="so-what-kinds-of-network-states-could-we-build">So what kinds of
network states could we build?</h2>
<p>Balaji outlines a few ideas for network states, which I will condense
into two key directions: <strong>lifestyle immersion</strong> and
<strong>pro-tech regulatory innovation</strong>.</p>
<p>Balaji's go-to example for lifestyle immersion is a network state
organized around health:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Next, let's do an example which requires a network archipelago (with
a physical footprint) but not a full network state (with diplomatic
recognition). This is <strong>Keto Kosher, the sugar-free
society</strong>.</p>
<p>Start with a history of the horrible USDA Food Pyramid, the
grain-heavy monstrosity that gave cover to the corporate sugarification
of the globe and the obesity epidemic. ... Organize a community online
that crowdfunds properties around the world, like apartment buildings
and gyms, and perhaps eventually even culdesacs and small towns. You
might take an extreme sugar teeotaler approach, literally banning
processed foods and sugar at the border, thereby implementing a kind of
"Keto Kosher".</p>
<p>You can imagine variants of this startup society that are like
"Carnivory Communities" or "Paleo People". These would be competing
startup societies in the same broad area, iterations on a theme. If
successful, such a society might not stop at sugar. It could get into
setting cultural defaults for fitness and exercise. Or perhaps it could
bulk purchase continuous glucose meters for all members, or orders of
metformin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, strictly speaking, does not require any diplomatic recognition
or even political autonomy - though perhaps, in the longer-term future,
such enclaves could negotiate for lower health insurance fees and
medicare taxes for their members. What does require autonomy? Well, how
about a free zone for medical innovation?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now let's do a more difficult example, which will require a full
network state with diplomatic recognition. This is <strong>the medical
sovereignty zone, the FDA-free society</strong>.</p>
<p>You begin your startup society with Henninger's history of FDA-caused
<a href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc1/DrugLag.html">drug lag</a>
and Tabarrok's history of FDA interference with so-called <a
href="https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_05_1_tabarrok.pdf">"off
label" prescription</a>. You point out how many millions were killed by
its policies, hand out t-shirts like ACT-UP did, show Dallas Buyers Club
to all prospective residents, and make clear to all new members why your
cause of medical sovereignty is righteous ...</p>
<p>For the case of doing it outside the US, your startup society would
ride behind, say, the support of the Malta's FDA for a new biomedical
regime. For the case of doing it within the US, you'd need a governor
who'd declare a sanctuary state for biomedicine. That is, just like a
sanctuary city declares that it won't enforce federal immigration law, a
sanctuary state for biomedicine would not enforce FDA writ.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One can think up of many more examples for both categories. One could
have a zone where it's okay to walk around naked, both securing your
legal right to do so and helping you <em>feel comfortable</em> by
creating an environment where many other people are naked too.
Alternatively, you could have a zone where everyone can only wear basic
plain-colored clothing, to discourage what's perceived as a zero-sum
status competition of expending huge effort to look better than everyone
else. One could have an intentional community zone for cryptocurrency
users, requiring every store to accept it and demanding an NFT to get in
the zone at all. Or one could build an enclave that legalizes radical
experiments in transit and drone delivery, accepting higher risks to
personal safety in exchange for the privilege of participating in a
technological frontier that will hopefully set examples for the world as
a whole.</p>
<p>What is common about all of these examples is the value of having a
physical region, at least of a few hectares, where the network state's
unique rules are enforced. Sure, you could individually insist on only
eating at healthy restaurants, and research each restaurant carefully
before you go there. But it's just <em>so much easier</em> to have a
defined plot of land where you have an assurance that anywhere you go
within that plot of land will meet your standards. Of course, you could
lobby your local government to tighten health and safety regulations.
But if you do that, you risk friction with people who have radically
different preferences on tradeoffs, and you risk <a

poor people out of the economy</a>. A network state offers a moderate
approach.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-balajis-megapolitical-case-for-network-states">What is
Balaji's megapolitical case for network states?</h2>
<p>One of the curious features of the book that a reader will notice
almost immediately is that it sometimes feels like two books in one:
sometimes, it's a book about the concept of network states, and at other
times it's an exposition of Balaji's grand megapolitical theory.</p>
<p>Balaji's grand megapolitical theory is pretty out-there and fun in a
bunch of ways. Near the beginning of the book, he entices readers with
tidbits like... ok fine, I'll just quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Germany sent
<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/how-germany-got-the-russian-revolution-off-the-ground/a-41195312" target="_blank">Vladimir

<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/19/opinion/was-lenin-a-german-agent.html" target="_blank">strategy</a>
to destabilize their then-rival in war. Antony Sutton's books document
how some
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wall-Street-Bolshevik-Revolution-Capitalists/dp/190557035X" target="_blank">Wall
Street</a> bankers apparently funded the Russian Revolution (and how
other Wall Street bankers
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N9M85GX" target="_blank">funded
the Nazis</a> years later). Leon Trotsky spent
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01I8S7EX6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1" target="_blank">time
in New York</a> prior to the revolution, and propagandistic reporting
from Americans like
<a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Reed" target="_blank">John

so useful to the Soviets — and so misleading as to the nature of the
revolution — that he was

at the base of the Kremlin Wall</a>. Surprise: the Russian Revolution
wasn't done wholly by Russians, but had significant foreign involvement
from Germans and Americans.</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can find a bunch more juicy examples in the chapter titled,
appropriately, "<a
href="https://thenetworkstate.com/if-the-news-is-fake-imagine-history">If
the News is Fake, Imagine History</a>". These examples seem haphazard,
and indeed, to some extent they are so intentionally: the goal is first
and foremost to shock the reader out of their existing world model so
they can start downloading Balaji's own.</p>
<p>But pretty soon, Balaji's examples do start to point to some
particular themes: a deep dislike of the "woke" US left, exemplified by
the New York Times, a combination of strong discomfort with the Chinese
Communist Party's authoritarianism with an understanding of why the CCP
often justifiably fears the United States, and an appreciation of the
love of freedom of the US right (exemplified by Bitcoin maximalists)
combined with a dislike of their hostility toward cooperation and
order.</p>
<p>Next, we get Balaji's overview of <a
href="https://thenetworkstate.com/left-is-the-new-right-is-the-new-left">the
political realignments in recent history</a>, and finally we get to his
core model of politics in the present day: <a
href="https://thenetworkstate.com/nyt-ccp-btc">NYT, CCP, BTC</a>.</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/networkstates/nytccpbtc.png"
class="padded" /></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Team NYT basically runs the US, and its total lack of competence
means that the US is collapsing. Team BTC (meaning, both actual Bitcoin
maximalists and US rightists in general) has some positive values, but
their outright hostility to collective action and order means that they
are incapable of building anything. Team CCP can build, but they are
building a dystopian surveillance state that much of the world would not
want to live in. And all three teams are waaay too nationalist: they
view things from the perspective of their own country, and ignore or
exploit everyone else. Even when the teams are internationalist in
theory, their specific ways of interpreting their values make them
unpalatable outside of a small part of the world.</p>
<p>Network states, in Balaji's view, are a "<a
href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1424148518940274688">de-centralized
center</a>" that could create a better alternative. They combine the
love of freedom of team BTC with the moral energy of team NYT and the
organization of team CCP, and give us the best benefits of all three
(plus a level of international appeal greater than <em>any</em> of the
three) and avoid the worst parts.</p>
<p>This is Balajian megapolitics in a nutshell. It is not trying to
justify network states using some abstract theory (eg. some Dunbar's
number or concentrated-incentive argument that the optimal size of a
political body is actually in the low tens of thousands). Rather, it is
an argument that situates network states as a response to the particular
political situation of the world at its current place and time.</p>

<p><small><i>Balaji's helical theory of history: yes, there are cycles,
but there is also ongoing progress. Right now, we're at the part of the
cycle where we need to help the sclerotic old order die, but also seed a
new and better one.</i></small></p>

<h2
id="do-you-have-to-agree-with-balajis-megapolitics-to-like-network-states">Do
you have to agree with Balaji's megapolitics to like network
states?</h2>
<p>Many aspects of Balajian megapolitics will not be convincing to many
readers. If you believe that "wokeness" is an important movement that
protects the vulnerable, you may not appreciate the almost off-handed
dismissal that it is basically just a mask for a professional elite's
will-to-power. If you are worried about the plight of smaller countries
such as Ukraine who are threatened by aggressive neighbors and
desperately need outside support, you will not be convinced by <a
href="https://thenetworkstate.com/people-of-god-people-of-the-state-people-of-the-network">Balaji's
plea</a> that "it may instead be best for countries to rearm, and take
on their own defense".</p>
<p>I do think that you can support network states while disagreeing with
some of Balaji's reasoning for them (and vice versa). But first, I
should explain why I <em>think</em> Balaji feels that his view of the
problem and his view of the solution are connected. Balaji has been
passionate about roughly the same problem for a long time; you can see a
similar narrative outline of defeating US institutional sclerosis
through a technological and exit-driven approach in <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOubCHLXT6A">his speech on "the
ultimate exit" from 2013</a>. Network states are the latest iteration of
his proposed solution.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why talking about the problem is
important:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To show that network states are the only way to protect
freedom and capitalism, one must show why the US cannot.</strong> If the
US, or the "democratic liberal order", is just fine, then there is no
need for alternatives; we should just double down on global coordination
and rule of law. But if the US is in an irreversible decline, and its
rivals are ascending, then things look quite different. Network states
can "maintain liberal values in an illiberal world"; hegemony thinking
that assumes "the good guys are in charge" cannot.</li>
<li><strong>Many of Balaji's intended readers are not in the US, and a
world of network states would inherently be globally distributed - and
that includes <em>lots</em> of people who are suspicious of
America</strong>. Balaji himself is Indian, and has a large Indian fan
base. Many people in India, and elsewhere, view the US not as a
"guardian of the liberal world order", but as something much more
hypocritical at best and sinister at worst. Balaji wants to make it
clear that you do not have to be pro-American to be a liberal (or at
least a Balaji-liberal).</li>
<li><strong>Many parts of US left-leaning media are increasingly hostile
to both cryptocurrency and the tech sector</strong>. Balaji expects that
the "authoritarian left" parts of "team NYT" will be hostile to network
states, and he explains this by pointing out that the media are not
angels and their attacks are often self-interested.</li>
</ul>
<p>But this is not the only way of looking at the broader picture. What
if you <em>do</em> believe in the importance of role of social justice
values, the New York Times, or America? What if you value governance
innovation, but have more moderate views on politics? Then, there are
two ways you could look at the issue:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Network states as a synergistic strategy, or at least as a
backup</strong>. Anything that happens in US politics in terms of
improving <em>equality</em>, for example, only benefits the ~4% of the
world's population that lives in the United States. The First Amendment
does not apply outside US borders. The governance of many wealthy
countries <em>is</em> sclerotic, and we do need <em>some</em> way to try
more governance innovation. Network states could fill in the gaps.
Countries like the United States could host network states that attract
people from all over the world. Successful network states could even
serve as a policy model for countries to adopt. Alternatively, <em>what
if</em> the Republicans win and secure a decades-long majority in 2024,
or the United States breaks down? You want there to be an
alternative.</li>
<li><strong>Exit to network states as a distraction, or even a
threat</strong>. If everyone's first instinct when faced with a large
problem within their country is to exit to an enclave elsewhere, there
will be no one left to protect and maintain the countries themselves.
Global infrastructure that ultimately network states depend on will
suffer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both perspectives are compatible with a lot of disagreement with
Balajian megapolitics. Hence, to argue for or against Balajian network
states, we will ultimately have to talk about network states. My own
view is friendly to network states, though with a lot of caveats and
different ideas about how network states could work.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-cryptocurrency-have-to-do-with-network-states">What
does cryptocurrency have to do with network states?</h2>
<p>There are two kinds of alignment here: there is the
<em>spiritual</em> alignment, the idea that <a
href="https://nakamoto.com/bitcoin-becomes-the-flag-of-technology/">"Bitcoin
becomes the flag of technology"</a>, and there is the <em>practical</em>
alignment, the specific ways in which network states could use
blockchains and cryptographic tokens. In general, I agree with both of
these arguments - though I think Balaji's book could do much more to
spell them out more explicitly.</p>
<h3 id="the-spiritual-alignment">The spiritual alignment</h3>
<p>Cryptocurrency in 2022 is a key standard-bearer for internationalist
liberal values that are difficult to find in any other social force that
still stands strong today. Blockchains and cryptocurrencies are
inherently global. Most Ethereum developers are outside the US, living
in far-flung places like Europe, Taiwan and Australia. NFTs have given
unique opportunities to <a
href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-nfts-empowered-artists-african-art-scenes">artists
in Africa</a> and <a
href="https://forkast.news/how-southeast-asias-nft-ecosystem-lifts-up-local-artists/">elsewhere
in the Global South</a>. Argentinians punch above their weight in
projects like Proof of Humanity, Kleros and Nomic Labs.</p>
<p>Blockchain communities continue to stand for openness, freedom,
censorship resistance and <a
href="https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/">credible
neutrality</a>, at a time where many geopolitical actors are
increasingly only serving their own interests. This enhances their
international appeal further: you don't have to love US hegemony to love
blockchains and the values that they stand for. And this all makes
blockchains an ideal spiritual companion for the network state vision
that Balaji wants to see.</p>
<h3 id="the-practical-alignment">The practical alignment</h3>
<p>But spiritual alignment means little without practical use value for
blockchains to go along with it. Balaji gives plenty of blockchain use
cases. One of Balaji's favorite concepts is the idea of the blockchain
as a "ledger of record": people can timestamp events on-chain, creating
a global provable log of humanity's "microhistory". He continues with
other examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a
href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/zero-knowledge-proofs">Zero-knowledge</a>
technology like <a href="https://z.cash/">ZCash</a>, <a
href="https://ironfish.network/">Ironfish</a>, and <a

of exactly what people want to make public and nothing more.</li>
<li>Naming systems like the <a href="https://ens.domains/">Ethereum Name
Service</a> (ENS) and <a href="https://naming.bonfida.org/">Solana Name
Service</a> (SNS) attach identity to on-chain transactions.</li>
<li>Incorporation systems allow the on-chain representation of corporate
abstractions above the level of a mere transaction, like financial
statements or even full programmable company-equivalents like DAOs.</li>
<li><a
href="https://tim.blog/2021/03/25/balaji-srinivasan-transcript/#:~:text=So%20the%20question%20then,except%20it%E2%80%99s%20non%2Dtransferrable.">Cryptocredentials</a>,

href="../../../2022/01/26/soulbound.html">Soulbounds</a> allow the
representation of non-financial data on chain, like diplomas or
endorsements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>But how does this all relate to network states? I could go into
specific examples in the vein of <a
href="../../../2021/10/31/cities.html">crypto cities</a>: issuing
tokens, issuing <a href="https://www.citydao.io/">CityDAO</a>-style
citizen NFTs, combining blockchains with zero-knowledge cryptography to
do <a href="../../../2021/05/25/voting2.html">secure privacy-preserving
voting</a>, and a lot more. Blockchains are <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/ctu2ud/vitalik_called_ethereum_the_lego_of_cryptofinance/">the
Lego of crypto-finance</a> and crypto-governance: they are a very
effective tool for implementing transparent in-protocol rules to govern
common resources, assets and incentives.</p>
<p>But we also need to go a level deeper. <strong>Blockchains and
network states have the shared property that they are both trying to
"create a new root"</strong>. A corporation is not a root: if there is a
dispute inside a corporation, it ultimately gets resolved by a national
court system. Blockchains and network states, on the other hand,
<em>are</em> trying to be new roots. This does not mean some absolute
"na na no one can catch me" ideal of sovereignty that is perhaps only
truly accessible to the ~5 countries that have highly self-sufficient
national economies and/or nuclear weapons. Individual blockchain
participants are of course vulnerable to national regulation, and
enclaves of network states even more so. But blockchains are the only
infrastructure system that at least <em>attempts</em> to do ultimate
dispute resolution at the non-state level (either through on-chain smart
contract logic or through the <a
href="../../../2021/03/23/legitimacy.html#coins-can-be-owned-by-social-contracts">freedom
to fork</a>). This makes them an ideal base infrastructure for network
states.</p>
<h2 id="what-aspects-of-balajis-vision-do-i-like">What aspects of
Balaji's vision do I like?</h2>
<p>Given that a purist "<a
href="https://mises.org/library/new-liberty-libertarian-manifesto">private
property rights only</a>" libertarianism inevitably runs into large
problems like its inability to fund public goods, any successful
pro-freedom program in the 21st century has to be a hybrid containing at
least one Big Compromise Idea that solves at least 80% of the problems,
so that independent individual initiative can take care of the rest.
This could be some stringent measures against economic power and wealth
concentration (maybe charge annual <a
href="https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=12668&amp;context=journal_articles">Harberger
taxes</a> on everything), it could be an 85% <a
href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/does-georgism-work-is-land-really">Georgist
land tax</a>, it could be a UBI, it could be mandating that sufficiently
large companies become democratic internally, or one of any other
proposals. Not all of these work, but you need <em>something</em> that
drastic to have any shot at all.</p>
<p>Generally, I am used to the Big Compromise Idea being a leftist one:
some form of equality and democracy. Balaji, on the other hand, has Big
Compromise Ideas that feel more rightist: local communities with shared
values, loyalty, religion, physical environments structured to encourage
personal discipline ("keto kosher") and hard work. These values are
implemented in a very libertarian and tech-forward way, organizing not
around land, history, ethnicity and country, but around the cloud and
personal choice, but they are rightist values nonetheless. This style of
thinking is foreign to me, but I find it fascinating, and important.
Stereotypical "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baizuo">wealthy
white liberals</a>" ignore this at their peril: these more "traditional"
values are actually quite popular even among <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/us/politics/latino-voters-democrats.html">some
ethnic minorities in the United States</a>, and even more so in places
like Africa and India, which is exactly where Balaji is trying to build
up his base.</p>
<h3
id="but-what-about-this-particular-baizuo-thats-currently-writing-this-review-do-network-states-actually-interest-me">But
what about this particular baizuo that's currently writing this review?
Do network states actually interest me?</h3>
<p>The "Keto Kosher" health-focused lifestyle immersion network state is
certainly one that I would want to live in. Sure, I could just spend
time in cities with lots of healthy stuff that I can seek out
intentionally, but a concentrated physical environment makes it so much
easier. Even the motivational aspect of being around other people who
share a similar goal sounds very appealing.</p>
<p>But the truly interesting stuff is the governance innovation: using
network states to organize in ways that would actually not be possible
under existing regulations. There are three ways that you can interpret
the underlying goal here:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Creating new <strong>regulatory environments that let their
residents have different priorities</strong> from the priorities
preferred by the mainstream: for example, the "anyone can walk around
naked" zone, or a zone that implements different tradeoffs between
safety and convenience, or a zone that legalizes more psychoactive
substances.</li>
<li>Creating new <strong>regulatory institutions that might be more
efficient at serving the same priorities</strong> as the status quo. For
example, instead of improving environmental friendliness by regulating
specific behaviors, you could just have a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigovian_tax">Pigovian tax</a>.
Instead of requiring licenses and regulatory pre-approval for many
actions, you could require <a
href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/2015/10/requirelegalliabilityinsurance.html">mandatory
liability insurance</a>. You could use <a
href="../../../2019/12/07/quadratic.html">quadratic voting</a> for
governance and quadratic funding to fund local public goods.</li>
<li><strong>Pushing against regulatory conservatism in general</strong>,
by increasing the chance that there's <em>some</em> jurisdiction that
will let you do any particular thing. Institutionalized bioethics, for
example, is a notoriously conservative enterprise, where 20 people dead
in a medical experiment gone wrong is a tragedy, but 200000 people dead
from <a
href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/3quCK79NT3r9tpC6Q/how-many-people-are-in-the-invisible-graveyard-1">life-saving
medicines and vaccines</a> not being approved quickly enough is a
statistic. Allowing people to opt into network states that accept higher
levels of risk could be a successful strategy for pushing against
this.</li>
</ol>
<p>In general, I see value in all three. A large-scale
institutionalization of [1] could make the word simultaneously more free
while making people comfortable with higher levels of restriction of
certain things, because they know that if they want to do something
disallowed there are other zones they could go to do it. More generally,
I think there is an important idea hidden in [1]: <strong>while the
"social technology" community has come up with many good ideas around
better <em>governance</em>, and many good ideas around better <em><a
href="https://pol.is/home">public discussion</a></em>, there is a
missing emphasis on better social technology for
<em>sorting</em></strong>. We don't just want to take existing maps of
social connections as given and find better ways to come to consensus
within them. We also want to reform the webs of social connections
themselves, and put people closer to other people that are more
compatible with them to better allow different ways of life to maintain
their own distinctiveness.</p>
<p>[2] is exciting because it fixes a major problem in politics: unlike
startups, where the early stage of the process looks somewhat like a
mini version of the later stage, in politics the early stage is a public
discourse game that often selects for very different things than what
actually work in practice. If governance ideas are regularly implemented
in network states, then we would <strong>move from an
extrovert-privileging "talker liberalism" to a more balanced "doer
liberalism" where ideas rise and fall based on how well they actually do
on a small scale</strong>. We could even combine [1] and [2]: have a
zone for people who want to automatically participate in a new
governance experiment every year as a lifestyle.</p>
<p>[3] is of course a more complicated moral question: whether you view
paralysis and creep toward de-facto authoritarian global government as a
bigger problem or someone inventing an evil technology that dooms us all
as a bigger problem. I'm generally in the first camp; I am concerned
about the prospect of <a
href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkLnBvZGJlYW4uY29tL3BhbGxhZGl1bW1hZy9mZWVkLnhtbA/episode/cGFsbGFkaXVtbWFnLnBvZGJlYW4uY29tL2RmODEzZmE1LTJlNmMtM2VjMC1hNmVhLWJjMjc0N2MyMmM4Nw?hl=en-ES&amp;ved=2ahUKEwirxaiY5O34AhUNQhoKHbVeB14QjrkEegQIAxAF&amp;ep=6">both

I <em>love</em> how imperfect coordination between nation states limits
the enforceability of things like global copyright law, and I'm
concerned about the possibility that, with future surveillance
technology, the world as a whole will enter a highly self-enforcing but
terrible political equilibrium that it cannot get out of. But there are
specific areas (cough cough, <a
href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uMQ3cqWDPHhjtiesc/agi-ruin-a-list-of-lethalities">unfriendly
AI risk</a>) where I am in the risk-averse camp ... but here we're already
getting into the second part of my reaction.</p>
<h2 id="what-aspects-of-balajis-vision-do-i-take-issue-with">What
aspects of Balaji's vision do I take issue with?</h2>
<p>There are four aspects that I am worried about the most:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The "founder" thing - why do network states need a recognized
founder to be so central?</li>
<li>What if network states end up only serving the wealthy?</li>
<li>"Exit" alone is not sufficient to stabilize global politics. So if
exit is everyone's first choice, what happens?</li>
<li>What about global negative externalities more generally?</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-founder-thing">The "founder" thing</h3>
<p>Throughout the book, Balaji is insistent on the importance of
"founders" in a network state (or rather, a <em>startup society</em>:
you found a startup society, and become a network state if you are
successful enough to get diplomatic recognition). Balaji explicitly
describes startup society founders as being "moral entrepreneurs":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These presentations are similar to startup pitch decks. But as the
founder of a startup society, you aren't a technology entrepreneur
telling investors why this new innovation is better, faster, and
cheaper. You are a moral entrepreneur telling potential future citizens
about a better way of life, about a single thing that the broader world
has gotten wrong that your community is setting right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Founders crystallize moral intuitions and <a
href="https://thenetworkstate.com/political-power-and-technological-truth">learnings
from history</a> into a concrete philosophy, and people whose moral
intuitions are compatible with that philosophy coalesce around the
project. This is all very reasonable at an early stage - though it is
definitely not the <em>only</em> approach for how a startup society
could emerge. But what happens at later stages? Mark Zuckerberg being
the centralized founder of facebook the startup was perhaps necessary.
But Mark Zuckerberg being in charge of a multibillion-dollar (in fact,
multibillion-<em>user</em>) company is something quite different. Or,
for that matter, what about Balaji's nemesis: the fifth-generation
hereditary white Ochs-Sulzberger dynasty running the New York Times?</p>
<p>Small things being centralized is great, extremely large things being
centralized is terrifying. And given the reality of network effects, the
freedom to exit again is not sufficient. In my view, the problem of how
to settle into something other than founder control is important, and
Balaji spends too little effort on it. "Recognized founder" is baked
into the definition of what a Balajian network state is, but a roadmap
toward wider participation in governance is not. It should be.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-everyone-who-is-not-wealthy">What about everyone who
is not wealthy?</h3>
<p>Over the last few years, we've seen many instances of governments
around the world becoming explicitly more open to "tech talent". There
are <a
href="https://nomadgirl.co/countries-with-digital-nomad-visas/">42
countries offering digital nomad visas</a>, there is a <a
href="https://lafrenchtech.com/en/how-france-helps-startups/french-tech-visa/">French
tech visa</a>, a <a
href="https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/how-we-help/incentives-and-schemes/tech-pass.html">similar
program in Singapore</a>, <a
href="https://goldcard.nat.gov.tw/en/">golden visas for Taiwan</a>, a
program for <a
href="https://www.dubaifuture.ae/initiatives/future-design-and-acceleration/golden-visa/">Dubai</a>,
and many others. This is all great for skilled professionals and rich
people. Multimillionaires fleeing China's tech crackdowns and covid
lockdowns (or, for that matter, moral disagreements with China's <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_China">other
policies</a>) can often escape <a
href="https://www.doyouneedvisa.com/passport/People&#39;s%20Republic%20of%20China">the
world's systemic discrimination against Chinese and other
low-income-country citizens</a> by spending a few hundred thousand
dollars on <a
href="https://www.businessinsider.com/second-passport-cost-dual-citizenship-by-investment-caribbean-europe-2020-1">buying
another passport</a>. But what about regular people? What about the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohingya_genocide">Rohingya minority
facing extreme conditions in Myanmar</a>, most of whom do not have a way
to enter the US or Europe, much less buy another passport?</p>
<p>Here, we see a potential tragedy of the network state concept. On the
one hand, I can really see how exit can be the most viable strategy for
global human rights protection in the twenty first century. What do you
do if another country is oppressing an ethnic minority? You could do
nothing. You could sanction them (often <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Public-Choice-Theory-Illusion-Strategy/dp/1032121793">ineffective</a>
and <a
href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-02-13/biden-s-decision-on-afghanistan-s-7-billion-in-foreign-reserves-is-cruel">ruinous</a>
to the very people you're trying to help). You could try to invade (same
criticism but even worse). Exit is a more humane option. People
suffering human rights atrocities could just pack up and leave for
friendlier pastures, and coordinating to do it in a group would mean
that they could leave without sacrificing the communities they depend on
for friendship and economic livelihood. And if you're wrong and the
government you're criticizing is actually not that oppressive, then
people won't leave and all is fine, no starvation or bombs required.
This is all beautiful and good. Except... the whole thing breaks down
because when the people try to exit, nobody is there to take them.</p>
<p>What is the answer? Honestly, I don't see one. One point in favor of
network states is that they could be based <em>in</em> poor countries,
and attract wealthy people from abroad who would then help the local
economy. But this does nothing for people in poor countries who <em>want
to get out</em>. Good old-fashioned political action within existing
states to liberalize immigration laws seems like the only option.</p>
<h3 id="nowhere-to-run">Nowhere to run</h3>
<p>In the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb 24, Noah Smith
wrote an <a
href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/a-moment-of-clarity">important
post</a> on the moral clarity that the invasion should bring to our
thought. A particularly striking section is titled "nowhere to run".
Quoting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But while exit works on a local level — if San Francisco is too
dysfunctional, you can probably move to Austin or another tech town — it
simply won't work at the level of nations. In fact, it never really did
— rich crypto guys who moved to countries like Singapore or territories
like Puerto Rico still depended crucially on the infrastructure and
institutions of highly functional states. But Russia is making it even
clearer that this strategy is doomed, because eventually there is
nowhere to run. Unlike in previous eras, the arm of the great powers is
long enough to reach anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>If the U.S. collapses, you can't just move to Singapore, because in a
few years you'll be bowing to your new Chinese masters. If the U.S.
collapses, you can't just move to Estonia, because in a few years
(months?) you'll be bowing to your new Russian masters. And those
masters will have extremely little incentive to allow you to remain a
free individual with your personal fortune intact ... Thus it is very very
important to every libertarian that the U.S. not collapse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One possible counter-argument is: sure, if Ukraine was full of people
whose first instinct was exit, Ukraine would have collapsed. But if
<em>Russia was also more exit-oriented</em>, everyone in Russia would
have pulled out of the country within a week of the invasion. Putin
would be left standing alone in the fields of the Luhansk oblast facing
Zelensky a hundred meters away, and when Putin shouts his demand for
surrender, Zelensky would reply: "you and what army"? (Zelensky would of
course win a fair one-on-one fight)</p>
<p>But things could go a different way. The risk is that exitocracy
becomes recognized as <em>the primary way you do the "freedom"
thing</em>, and societies that value freedom will become exitocratic,
but centralized states will censor and suppress these impulses, adopt a
militaristic attitude of national unconditional loyalty, and run
roughshod over everyone else.</p>
<h3 id="so-what-about-those-negative-externalities">So what about those
negative externalities?</h3>
<p>If we have a hundred much-less-regulated innovation labs everywhere
around the world, this could lead to a world where harmful things are
more difficult to prevent. This raises a question: <strong>does
believing in Balajism <em>require</em> believing in a world where
negative externalities are <em>not too big</em> a deal?</strong> Such a
viewpoint would be <em>the opposite</em> of the <a
href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/vulnerable-world-hypothesis">Vulnerable
World Hypothesis (VWH)</a>, which suggests that are technology
progresses, it gets easier and easier for one or a few crazy people to
kill millions, and global authoritarian surveillance might be
<em>required</em> to prevent extreme suffering or even extinction.</p>
<p>One way out might be to focus on self-defense technology. Sure, in a
network state world, we could not feasibly ban gain-of-function
research, but we could use network states to help the world along a path
to adopting really good <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02669-2">HEPA air
filtering</a>, <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-08462-z">far-UVC
light</a>, early detection <a
href="https://www.epiwatch.org/">infrastructure</a> and a very rapid
vaccine development and deployment pipeline that could defeat not only
covid, but far worse viruses too. <a
href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/andy-weber-rendering-bioweapons-obsolete/">This
80,000 hours episode</a> outlines the bull case for bioweapons being a
solvable problem. But this is not a universal solution for all
technological risks: at the very least, there is no self-defense against
a super-intelligent unfriendly AI that kills us all.</p>
<p>Self-defense technology is good, and is probably an undervalued
funding focus area. But it's not realistic to rely on that alone.
Transnational cooperation to, for example, <a
href="https://futureoflife.org/2021/12/13/special-newsletter-slaughterbots-sequel/">ban
slaughterbots</a>, would be required. And so we do want a world where,
even if network states have more sovereignty than intentional
communities today, their sovereignty is not <em>absolute</em>.</p>
<h2 id="non-balajian-network-states">Non-Balajian network states</h2>
<p>Reading <em>The Network State</em> reminded me of a different book
that I read ten years ago: David de Ugarte's <em><a
href="http://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Phyles">Phyles: Economic Democracy
in the Twenty First Century</a></em>. <em>Phyles</em> talks about
similar ideas of transnational communities organized around values, but
it has a much more left-leaning emphasis: it assumes that these
communities will be democratic, inspired by a combination of 2000s-era
online communities and nineteenth and twentieth-century ideas of
cooperatives and workplace democracy.</p>
<p>We can see the differences most clearly by looking at de Ugarte's
theory of formation. Since I've already spent a lot of time quoting
Balaji, I'll give de Ugarte a fair hearing with a longer quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The very blogosphere is an ocean of identities and conversation in
perpetual cross-breeding and change from among which the great social
digestion periodically distils stable groups with their own contexts and
specific knowledge.</p>
<p>These conversational communities which crystallise, after a certain
point in their development, play the main roles in what we call digital
Zionism: they start to precipitate into reality, to generate mutual
knowledge among their members, which makes them more identitarially
important to them than the traditional imaginaries of the imagined
communities to which they are supposed to belong (nation, class,
congregation, etc.) as if it were a real community (group of friends,
family, guild, etc.)</p>
<p>Some of these conversational networks, identitarian and dense, start
to generate their own economic metabolism, and with it a distinct demos
– maybe several demoi – which takes the nurturing of the autonomy of the
community itself as its own goal. These are what we call Neo-Venetianist
networks. Born in the blogosphere, they are heirs to the hacker work
ethic, and move in the conceptual world, which tends to the economic
democracy which we spoke about in the first part of this book.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional cooperativism, as they do not spring from real
proximity-based communities, their local ties do not generate identity.
In the Indianos' foundation, for instance, there are residents in two
countries and three autonomous regions, who started out with two
companies founded hundreds of kilometres away from each other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We see some very Balajian ideas: shared collective identities, but
formed around values rather than geography, that start off as discussion
communities in the cloud but then materialize into taking over large
portions of economic life. De Ugarte even uses the exact same metaphor
("digital Zionism") that Balaji does!</p>
<p>But we also see a key difference: there is no single founder. Rather
than a startup society being formed by an act of a single individual
combining together intuitions and strands of thought into a coherent
formally documented philosophy, a phyle starts off as a conversational
network in the blogosphere, and then directly turns into a group that
does more and more over time - all while keeping its democratic and
horizontal nature. The whole process is much more organic, and not at
all guided by a single person's intention.</p>
<p>Of course, the immediate challenge that I can see is the incentive
issues inherent to such structures. One way to perhaps unfairly
summarize both <em>Phyles</em> and <em>The Network State</em> is that
<em>The Network State</em> seeks to use 2010s-era blockchains as a model
for how to reorganize human society, and <em>Phyles</em> seeks to use
2000s-era open source software communities and blogs as a model for how
to reorganize human society. Open source has the failure mode of <em>not
enough incentives</em>, cryptocurrency has the failure mode of
<em>excessive and overly concentrated incentives</em>. But what this
does suggest is that some kind of middle way should be possible.</p>
<h2 id="is-there-a-middle-way">Is there a middle way?</h2>
<p>My judgement so far is that network states are great, but they are
far from being a viable Big Compromise Idea that can actually plug all
the holes needed to build the kind of world I and most of my readers
would want to see in the 21st century. Ultimately, I do think that we
need to bring in more democracy and large-scale-coordination oriented
Big Compromise Ideas of some kind to make network states truly
successful.</p>
<p>Here are some significant adjustments to Balajism that I would
endorse:</p>
<h3
id="founder-to-start-is-okay-though-not-the-only-way-but-we-really-need-a-baked-in-roadmap-to-exit-to-community">Founder
to start is okay (though not the only way), but we really need a
baked-in roadmap to exit-to-community</h3>
<p>Many founders <em>want</em> to eventually retire or start something
new (see: basically half of every crypto project), and we need to
prevent network states from collapsing or sliding into mediocrity when
that happens. Part of this process is some kind of constitutional
<strong>exit-to-community</strong> guarantee: as the network state
enters higher tiers of maturity and scale, more input from community
members is taken into account automatically.</p>
<p>Prospera attempted something like this. As Scott Alexander <a
href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/prospectus-on-prospera">summarizes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once Próspera has 100,000 residents (so realistically a long time
from now, if the experiment is very successful), they can hold a
referendum where 51% majority can change anything about the charter,
including kicking HPI out entirely and becoming a direct democracy, or
rejoining the rest of Honduras, or anything</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I would favor something even more participatory than the
residents having an all-or-nothing nuclear option to kick the government
out.</p>
<p>Another part of this process, and one that I've recognized in the
process of Ethereum's growth, is explicitly encouraging broader
participation in the moral and philosophical development of the
community. Ethereum has its Vitalik, but it also has its <a
href="https://twitter.com/apolynya">Polynya</a>: an internet anon who
has recently entered the scene unsolicited and started providing
high-quality thinking on rollups and scaling technology. How will your
startup society recruit its first ten Polynyas?</p>
<h3
id="network-states-should-be-run-by-something-thats-not-coin-driven-governance">Network
states should be run by something that's not coin-driven governance</h3>
<p>Coin-driven governance is plutocratic and vulnerable to attacks; I
have <a href="../../../2018/03/28/plutocracy.html">written</a> about <a
href="../../../2021/08/16/voting3.html">this</a> many <a
href="../../../2021/09/26/limits.html">times</a>, but it's worth
repeating. Ideas like Optimism's <a
href="../../../2022/01/26/soulbound.html">soulbound</a> and
one-per-person <a
href="https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/">citizen</a> NFTs
are key here. Balaji already acknowledges the need for non-fungibility
(he <a
href="https://mobile.twitter.com/balajis/status/1405819601959546885">supports
coin lockups</a>), but we should go further and more explicit in
supporting governance that's not just shareholder-driven. This will also
have the beneficial side effect that more democratic governance is more
likely to be aligned with the outside world.</p>
<h3
id="network-states-commit-to-making-themselves-friendly-through-outside-representation-in-governance">Network
states commit to making themselves friendly through outside
representation in governance</h3>
<p>One of the fascinating and under-discussed ideas from the rationalist
and friendly-AI community is <em><a
href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/functional-decision-theory">functional
decision theory</a></em>. This is a complicated concept, but the
powerful core idea is that AIs could coordinate better than humans,
solving prisoner's dilemmas where humans often fail, by making
verifiable public commitments about their source code. An AI could
rewrite itself to have a module that prevents it from cheating other AIs
that have a similar module. Such AIs would all cooperate with each other
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma">in
prisoner's dilemmas</a>.</p>
<p>As I <a
href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/why-cryptoeconomics-and-x-risk-researchers-should-listen-to-each-other-more-a2db72b3e86b">pointed
out years ago</a>, DAOs could potentially do the same thing. They could
have governance mechanisms that are explicitly more charitable toward
other DAOs that have a similar mechanism. Network states would be run by
DAOs, and this would apply to network states too. They could even commit
to governance mechanisms that promise to take wider public interests
into account (eg. 20% of the votes could go to a randomly selected set
of residents of the host city or country), without the burden of having
to follow specific complicated regulations of <em>how</em> they should
take those interests into account. A world where network states do such
a thing, and where countries adopt policies that are explicitly more
friendly to network states that do it, could be a better one.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I want to see startup societies along these kinds of visions exist. I
want to see immersive lifestyle experiments around healthy living. I
want to see crazy governance experiments where public goods are funded
by quadratic funding, and all zoning laws are replaced by a system where
every building's property tax floats between zero and five percent per
year based on what percentage of nearby residents express approval or
disapproval in a real-time <a
href="../../../2021/05/25/voting2.html">blockchain and ZKP-based voting
system</a>. And I want to see more technological experiments that accept
higher levels of risk, if the people taking those risks consent to it.
And I think blockchain-based tokens, identity and reputation systems and
DAOs could be a great fit.</p>
<p>At the same time, I worry that the network state vision in its
current form risks only satisfying these needs for those wealthy enough
to move and desirable enough to attract, and many people lower down the
socioeconomic ladder will be left in the dust. What can be said in
network states' favor is their internationalism: we even have the
Africa-focused <a
href="https://afropolitan.mirror.xyz/qkBv4y7MidTpDZJVEIEBC4EZi70v30IrCXLCZ-F6eMs">Afropolitan</a>.
Inequalities <em>between countries</em> are <a
href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2019/10/23/yes-global-inequality-has-fallen-no-we-shouldnt-be-complacent">responsible
for two thirds of global inequality</a> and inequalities <em>within</em>
countries are only one third. But that still leaves a lot of people in
all countries that this vision doesn't do much for. So we need something
else too - for the global poor, for Ukrainians that want to keep their
country and not just squeeze into Poland for a decade until Poland gets
invaded too, and everyone else that's not in a position to move to a
network state tomorrow or get accepted by one.</p>
<p>Network states, with some modifications that push for more democratic
governance and positive relationships with the communities that surround
them, <em>plus</em> some other way to help everyone else? That is a
vision that I can get behind.</p>
