<p><em>Special thanks to Balaji Srinivasan, and Coinbase, Kraken and
Binance staff for discussion.</em></p>
<p>Every time a major centralized exchange blows up, a common question
that comes up is whether or not we can use cryptographic techniques to
solve the problem. Rather than relying solely on "fiat" methods like
government licenses, auditors and examining the corporate governance and
the backgrounds of the individuals running the exchange, exchanges could
create cryptographic <em>proofs</em> that show that the funds they hold
on-chain are enough to cover their liabilities to their users.</p>
<p>Even more ambitiously, an exchange could build a system where it
can't withdraw a depositor's funds at all without their consent.
Potentially, we could explore the entire spectrum between the "don't be
evil" aspiring-good-guy CEX and the "can't be evil", but for-now
inefficient and privacy-leaking, on-chain DEX. This post will get into
the history of attempts to move exchanges one or two steps closer to
trustlessness, the limitations of these techniques, and some newer and
more powerful ideas that rely on <a
href="../../../2021/01/26/snarks.html">ZK-SNARKs</a> and other advanced
technologies.</p>
<h2
id="balance-lists-and-merkle-trees-old-school-proof-of-solvency">Balance
lists and Merkle trees: old-school proof-of-solvency</h2>
<p>The earliest attempts by exchanges to try to cryptographically prove
that they are not cheating their users go back quite far. In 2011,
then-largest Bitcoin exchange MtGox proved that they had funds by
sending <a
href="https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/3a1b9e330d32fef1ee42f8e86420d2be978bbe0dc5862f17da9027cf9e11f8c4">a
transaction</a> that <a
href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mt._Gox#Trading_incidents">moved 424242
BTC</a> to a pre-announced address. In 2013, <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106070229/https://people.xiph.org/~greg/bitcoin-wizards-fraud-proof.log.txt">discussions
started</a> on how to solve the other side of the problem: proving the
total size of customers' deposits. If you prove that customers' deposits
equal X ("<strong>proof of liabilities</strong>"), and prove ownership
of the private keys of X coins ("<strong>proof of assets</strong>"),
then you have a <strong>proof of solvency</strong>: you've proven the
exchange has the funds to pay back all of its depositors.</p>
<p>The simplest way to prove deposits is to simply publish a list of
<code>(username, balance)</code> pairs. Each user can check that their
balance is included in the list, and anyone can check the full list to
see that (i) every balance is non-negative, and (ii) the total sum is
the claimed amount. Of course, this breaks privacy, so we can change the
scheme a little bit: publish a list of
<code>(hash(username, salt), balance)</code> pairs, and send each user
privately their <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)"><code>salt</code></a>
value. But even this leaks balances, and it leaks the pattern of changes
in balances. The desire to preserve privacy <a
href="https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/37060/is-there-a-generally-agreed-on-protocol-for-creating-proof-of-solvency">brings
us</a> to the <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170114112433/https://iwilcox.me.uk/2014/proving-bitcoin-reserves#merkle_top">next
invention</a>: <strong>the Merkle tree technique</strong>.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>The Merkle tree technique consists of putting the table of customers'
balances into a <strong>Merkle sum tree</strong>. In a Merkle sum tree,
each node is a <code>(balance, hash)</code> pair. The bottom-layer leaf
nodes represent the balances and salted username hashes of individual
customers. In each higher-layer node, the balance is the sum of the two
balances below, and the hash is the hash of the two nodes below. A
Merkle sum proof, like a Merkle proof, is a "branch" of the tree,
consisting of the sister nodes along the path from a leaf to the
root.</p>
<p>The exchange would send each user a Merkle sum proof of their
balance. The user would then have a guarantee that their balance is
correctly included as part of the total. <strong>A simple example code
implementation can be found <a

<p>Privacy leakage in this design is much lower than with a fully public
list, and it can be decreased further by shuffling the branches each
time a root is published, but some privacy leakage is still there:
Charlie learns that <em>someone</em> has a balance of 164 ETH,
<em>some</em> two users have balances that add up to 70 ETH, etc. An
attacker that controls many accounts could still potentially learn a
significant amount about the exchange's users.</p>
<p>One important subtlety of the scheme is the possibility of
<em>negative</em> balances: what if an exchange that has 1390 ETH of
customer balances but only 890 ETH in reserves tries to make up the
difference by adding a -500 ETH balance under a fake account somewhere
in the tree? It turns out that this possibility does not break the
scheme, though this is the reason why we specifically need a Merkle sum
tree and not a regular Merkle tree. Suppose that Henry is the fake
account controlled by the exchange, and the exchange puts -500 ETH
there:</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img
src="../../../../images/proof_of_solvency/merkle_tree_2.png" /></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Greta's proof verification would fail: the exchange would have to
give her Henry's -500 ETH node, which she would reject as invalid. Eve
and Fred's proof verification would <em>also</em> fail, because the
intermediate node above Henry has -230 total ETH, and so is also
invalid! To get away with the theft, the exchange would have to hope
that nobody in the entire right half of the tree checks their balance
proof.</p>
<p>If the exchange can identify 500 ETH worth of users that they are
confident will either not bother to check the proof, or will not be
believed when they complain that they never received a proof, they could
get away with the theft. But then the exchange could also just exclude
those users from the tree and have the same effect. Hence, the Merkle
tree technique is basically as good as a proof-of-liabilities scheme can
be, if only achieving a proof of liabilities is the goal. But its
privacy properties are still not ideal. You can go a little bit further
by using Merkle trees in more clever ways, like <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/research/blob/master/proof_of_solvency/crazy_merkle_tree.py">making
each satoshi or wei a separate leaf</a>, but ultimately with more modern
tech there are even better ways to do it.</p>
<h3 id="improving-privacy-and-robustness-with-zk-snarks">Improving
privacy and robustness with ZK-SNARKs</h3>
<p>ZK-SNARKs are a powerful technology. ZK-SNARKs may be to cryptography
what <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)">transformers</a>
are to AI: a general-purpose technology that is so powerful that it will
completely steamroll a whole bunch of application-specific techniques
for a whole bunch of problems that were developed in the decades prior.
And so, of course, we can use ZK-SNARKs to greatly simplify and improve
privacy in proof-of-liabilities protocols.</p>
<p>The simplest thing that we can do is put all users' deposits into a
Merkle tree (or, even simpler, a <a
href="https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2020/06/16/kate-polynomial-commitments.html">KZG
commitment</a>), and use a ZK-SNARK to prove that all balances in the
tree are non-negative and add up to some claimed value. If we add a
layer of hashing for privacy, the Merkle branch (or KZG proof) given to
each user would reveal <em>nothing</em> about the balance of any other
user.</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/proof_of_solvency/kzg.png" /></p>
<p><i><small></p>
<p>Using KZG commitments is one way to avoid privacy leakage, as there
is no need to provide "sister nodes" as proofs, and a simple ZK-SNARK
can be used to prove the sum of the balances and that each balance is
non-negative.</p>
</small></i>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>We can prove the sum and non-negativity of balances in the above KZG
with a special-purpose ZK-SNARK. Here is one simple example way to do
this. We introduce an auxiliary polynomial <span
class="math inline">\(I(x)\)</span>, which "builds up the bits" of each
balance (we assume for the sake of example that balances are under <span
class="math inline">\(2^{15}\)</span>) and where every 16th position
tracks a running total with an offset so that it sums to zero only if
the actual total matches the declared total. If <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is an order-128 root of unity, we might
prove the equations:</p>
<center>
<p><span class="math inline">\(I(z^{16x}) = 0\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(I(z^{16x + 14}) =
P(\omega^{2x+1})\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(I(z^{i}) - 2*I(z^{i-1}) \in \{0, 1\}\ \
if\ \ i\ \ mod\ 16 \not \in \{0, 15\}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(I(z^{16*x + 15}) = I(z^{16*x-1}) +
I(z^{16*x+14}) - \frac{the\ declared\ total}{user\ count}\)</span></p>
</center>
<p>The first values of a valid setting for <span
class="math inline">\(I(x)\)</span> would be <code>0 0 0 0</code>
<code>0 0 0 0</code> <code>0 0 1 2</code> <code>5 10 20 -165</code>
<code>0 0 0 0</code> <code>0 0 0 0</code> <code>0 1 3 6</code>
<code>12 25 50 -300</code> ...</p>
<p>See <a
href="../../../2021/01/26/snarks.html#comparing-a-polynomial-to-itself">here</a>
and <a
href="../../../2021/01/26/snarks.html#whats-a-slightly-more-useful-example-of-a-computation-being-converted-into-a-set-of-polynomial-equations">here</a>
in <a href="../../../2021/01/26/snarks.html">my post on ZK-SNARKs</a>
for further explanation of how to convert equations like these into a
polynomial check and then into a ZK-SNARK. This isn't an optimal
protocol, but it does show how these days these kinds of cryptographic
proofs are not that spooky!</p>
<p>With only a few extra equations, constraint systems like this can be
adapted to more complex settings. For example, in a leverage trading
system, an individual users having negative balances is acceptable but
only if they have enough other assets to cover the funds with some
collateralization margin. A SNARK could be used to prove this more
complicated constraint, reassuring users that the exchange is not
risking their funds by <a
href="https://decrypt.co/114941/god-mode-sbf-alameda-secret-exemptions-ftx-liquidation">secretly
exempting other users</a> from the rules.</p>
<p>In the longer-term future, this kind of ZK proof of liabilities could
perhaps be used not just for customer deposits at exchanges, but for
lending more broadly. Anyone taking out a loan would put a record into a
polynomial or a tree containing that loan, and the root of that
structure would get published on-chain. This would let anyone seeking a
loan ZK-prove to the lender that they have not yet taken out too many
other loans. Eventually, legal innovation could even make loans that
have been committed to in this way higher-priority than loans that have
not. This leads us in exactly the same direction as one of the ideas
that was discussed in the <a
href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763">"Decentralized
Society: Finding Web3's Soul" paper</a>: a general notion of negative
reputation or encumberments on-chain through some form of "soulbound
tokens".</p>
<h2 id="proof-of-assets">Proof of assets</h2>
<p>The simplest version of proof of assets is the protocol that we saw
above: to prove that you hold X coins, you simply move X coins around at
some pre-agreed time or in a transaction where the data field contains
the words "these funds belong to Binance". To avoid paying transaction
fees, you could sign an off-chain message instead; both <a
href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Message_signing">Bitcoin</a> and <a
href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ethereum-eip712-signature-2021-spec/">Ethereum</a>
have standards for <a
href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0322.mediawiki">off-chain</a>
signed <a
href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271">messages</a>.</p>
<p>There are two practical problems with this simple proof-of-assets
technique:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dealing with cold storage</strong></li>
<li><strong>Collateral dual-use</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>For safety reasons, most exchanges keep the great majority of
customer funds in "cold storage": on offline computers, where
transactions need to be signed and carried over onto the internet
manually. Literal air-gapping is common: a cold storage setup that I
used to use for personal funds involved a permanently offline computer
generating a QR code containing the signed transaction, which I would
scan from my phone. Because of the high values at stake, the security
protocols used by exchanges are crazier still, and often involve using
multi-party computation between several devices to further reduce the
chance of a hack against a single device compromising a key. Given this
kind of setup, making even a single extra message to prove control of an
address is an expensive operation!</p>
<p>There are several paths that an exchange can take:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep a few public long-term-use addresses</strong>. The
exchange would generate a few addresses, publish a proof of each address
<em>once</em> to prove ownership, and then use those addresses
repeatedly. This is by far the simplest option, though it does add some
constraints in how to preserve security and privacy.</li>
<li><strong>Have many addresses, prove a few randomly</strong>. The
exchange would have many addresses, perhaps even using each address only
once and retiring it after a single transaction. In this case, the
exchange may have a protocol where from time to time a few addresses get
randomly selected and must be "opened" to prove ownership. Some
exchanges already do something like this with an auditor, but in
principle this technique could be turned into a fully automated
procedure.</li>
<li><strong>More complicated ZKP options</strong>. For example, an
exchange could set all of its addresses to be 1-of-2 multisigs, where
one of the keys is different per address, and the other is a blinded
version of some "grand" emergency backup key stored in some complicated
but very high-security way, eg. a 12-of-16 multisig. To preserve privacy
and avoid revealing the entire set of its addresses, the exchange could
even run a zero knowledge proof over the blockchain where it proves the
total balance of all addresses on chain that have this format.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other major issue is guarding against collateral dual-use.
Shuttling collateral back and forth between each other to do proof of
reserves is something that exchanges <a
href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1591690261029130240">could
easily do</a>, and would allow them to pretend to be solvent when they
actually are not. Ideally, proof of solvency would be done in real time,
with a proof that updates after every block. If this is impractical, the
next best thing would be to coordinate on a fixed schedule between the
different exchanges, eg. proving reserves at 1400 UTC every Tuesday.</p>
<p>One final issue is: <strong>can you do proof-of-assets on
fiat?</strong> Exchanges don't just hold cryptocurrency, they also hold
fiat currency within the banking system. Here, the answer is: yes, but
such a procedure would inevitably rely on "fiat" trust models: the bank
itself can attest to balances, auditors can attest to balance sheets,
etc. Given that fiat is not cryptographically verifiable, this is the
best that can be done within that framework, but it's still worth
doing.</p>
<p>An alternative approach would be to cleanly separate between one
entity that runs the exchange and deals with asset-backed stablecoins
like USDC, and another entity (USDC itself) that handles the cash-in and
cash-out process for moving between crypto and traditional banking
systems. Because the "liabilities" of USDC are just on-chain ERC20
tokens, proof of liabilities comes "for free" and only proof of assets
is required.</p>
<h2 id="plasma-and-validiums-can-we-make-cexes-non-custodial">Plasma and
validiums: can we make CEXes non-custodial?</h2>
<p>Suppose that we want to go further: we don't want to just prove that
the exchange <em>has the funds</em> to pay back its users. Rather, we
want to <strong>prevent the exchange from stealing users' funds
completely</strong>.</p>
<p>The first major attempt at this was <strong>Plasma</strong>, a
scaling solution that was popular in Ethereum research circles in 2017
and 2018. Plasma works by splitting up the balance into a set of
individual "coins", where each coin is assigned an index and lives in a
particular position in the Merkle tree of a Plasma block. Making a valid
transfer of a coin requires putting a transaction into the correct
position of a tree whose root gets published on-chain.</p>

<p><i><small></p>
<p>Oversimplified diagram of one version of Plasma. Coins are held in a
smart contract that enforces the rules of the Plasma protocol at
withdrawal time.</p>
</small></i>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>OmiseGo attempted to make a decentralized exchange based on this
protocol, but since then they have pivoted to other ideas - as has, for
that matter, Plasma Group itself, which is now the optimistic EVM rollup
project <a href="https://www.optimism.io/">Optimism</a>.</p>
<p>It's not worth looking at the technical limitations of Plasma as
conceived in 2018 (eg. <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/plasma-cash-defragmentation/3410">proving
coin defragmentation</a>) as some kind of morality tale about the whole
concept. Since the peak of Plasma discourse in 2018, ZK-SNARKs have
become much more viable for scaling-related use cases, and as we have
said above, ZK-SNARKs change everything.</p>
<p>The more modern version of the Plasma idea is what Starkware calls a
<a
href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/validium/">validium</a>:
basically the same as a ZK-rollup, except where data is held off-chain.
This construction could be used for a lot of use cases, conceivably
anything where a centralized server needs to run some code and prove
that it's executing code correctly. <strong>In a validium, the operator
has <em>no</em> way to steal funds, though depending on the details of
the implementation some quantity of user funds could get <em>stuck</em>
if the operator disappears.</strong></p>
<p>This is all really good: far from CEX vs DEX being a binary, it turns
out that there is a whole spectrum of options, including various forms
of hybrid centralization where you gain some benefits like efficiency
but still have a lot of cryptographic guardrails preventing the
centralized operator from engaging in most forms of abuses.</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/proof_of_solvency/spectrum.png" /></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>But it's worth getting to the fundamental issue with the right half
of this design space: <strong>dealing with user errors</strong>. By far
the most important type of error is: what if a user forgets their
password, loses their devices, gets hacked, or otherwise loses access to
their account?</p>
<p>Exchanges can solve this problem: first e-mail recovery, and if even
that fails, more complicated forms of recovery through KYC. But to be
able to solve such problems, the exchange needs to actually have control
over the coins. In order to have the ability to recover user accounts'
funds for good reasons, exchanges need to have power that could also be
used to steal user accounts' funds for bad reasons. This is an
unavoidable tradeoff.</p>
<p>The ideal long-term solution is to rely on self-custody, in a future
where users have easy access to technologies such as <a
href="../../../2021/01/11/recovery.html">multisig and social recovery
wallets</a> to help deal with emergency situations. But <em>in the short
term</em>, there are two clear alternatives that have clearly distinct
costs and benefits:</p>

<td>Non-custodial exchange (eg. Uniswap today)</td>
<td>User can withdraw even if exchange acts maliciously</td>
<td>User funds may be lost if user screws up</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br></p>
<p>Another important issue is cross-chain support: exchanges need to
support many different chains, and systems like Plasma and validiums
would need to have code written in different languages to support
different platforms, and cannot be implemented at all on others (notably
Bitcoin) in their current form. In the long-term future, this can
hopefully be fixed with technological upgrades and standardization; in
the short term, however, it's another argument in favor of custodial
exchanges remaining custodial for now.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions-the-future-of-better-exchanges">Conclusions: the
future of better exchanges</h2>
<p>In the short term, there are two clear "classes" of exchanges:
custodial exchanges and non-custodial exchanges. Today, the latter
category is just DEXes such as Uniswap, and in the future we may also
see cryptographically "constrained" CEXes where user funds are held in
something like a validium smart contract. We may also see half-custodial
exchanges where we trust them with fiat but not cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Both types of exchanges will continue to exist, and the easiest
backwards-compatible way to improve the safety of custodial exchanges is
to add proof of reserve. This consists of a combination of proof of
assets and proof of liabilities. There are technical challenges in
making good protocols for both, but we can and should go as far as
possible to make headway in both, and open-source the software and
processes as much as possible so that all exchanges can benefit.</p>
<p>In the longer-term future, my hope is that we move closer and closer
to all exchanges being non-custodial, at least on the crypto side.
Wallet recovery would exist, and there may need to be highly centralized
recovery options for new users dealing with small amounts, as well as
institutions that require such arrangements for legal reasons, but this
can be done at the wallet layer rather than within the exchange itself.
On the fiat side, movement between the traditional banking system and
the crypto ecosystem could be done via cash in / cash out processes
native to asset-backed stablecoins such as USDC. However, it will still
take a while before we can fully get there.</p>
