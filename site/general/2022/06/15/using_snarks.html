<title> Some ways to use ZK-SNARKs for privacy </title>

<p><em>Special thanks to Barry Whitehat and Gubsheep for feedback and
review.</em></p>
<p>ZK-SNARKs are a powerful cryptographic tool, and an increasingly
important part of the applications that people are building both in the
blockchain space and beyond. But they are complicated, both in terms of
<em>how they work</em>, and in terms of <em>how you can use
them</em>.</p>
<p>My <a href="../../../2021/01/26/snarks.html">previous post explaining
ZK-SNARKs</a> focused on the first question, attempting to explain the
math behind ZK-SNARKs in a way that's reasonably understandable but
still theoretically complete. This post will focus on the second
question: how do ZK-SNARKs fit into existing applications, what are some
examples of what they can do, what can't they do, and what are some
general guidelines for figuring out whether or not ZK-SNARKing some
particular application is possible?</p>
<p><strong>In particular, this post focuses on applications of ZK-SNARKs
for preserving privacy</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-a-zk-snark-do">What does a ZK-SNARK do?</h2>
<p>Suppose that you have a public input <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, a private input <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span>, and a (public) function <span
class="math inline">\(f(x, w) \rightarrow \{True, False\}\)</span> that
performs some kind of verification on the inputs. With a ZK-SNARK, you
can prove that you know an <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> such
that <span class="math inline">\(f(x, w) = True\)</span> for some given
<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, without revealing what <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> is. Additionally, the verifier can
verify the proof much faster it would take for them to compute <span
class="math inline">\(f(x, w)\)</span> themselves, even if they know
<span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>.</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>

</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>This gives the ZK-SNARK its two properties: <strong>privacy</strong>
and <strong>scalability</strong>. As mentioned above, in this post our
examples will focus on privacy.</p>
<h2 id="proof-of-membership">Proof of membership</h2>
<p>Suppose that you have an Ethereum wallet, and you want to prove that
this wallet has a proof-of-humanity registration, without revealing
<em>which</em> registered human you are. We can mathematically describe
the function as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>private input</strong> (<span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span>): your address <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, and the private key <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> to your address</li>
<li>The <strong>public input</strong> (<span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>): the set of all addresses with
verified proof-of-humanity profiles <span class="math inline">\(\{H_1
... H_n\}\)</span></li>
<li>The <strong>verification function</strong> <span
class="math inline">\(f(x, w)\)</span>:
<ul>
<li>Interpret <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> as the pair <span
class="math inline">\((A, k)\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> as the list of valid profiles <span
class="math inline">\(\{H_1 ... H_n\}\)</span></li>
<li>Verify that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is one of the
addresses in <span class="math inline">\(\{H_1 ... H_n\}\)</span></li>
<li>Verify that <span class="math inline">\(privtoaddr(k) =
A\)</span></li>
<li>Return <span class="math inline">\(True\)</span> if both
verifications pass, <span class="math inline">\(False\)</span> if either
verification fails</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The prover generates their address <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and the associated key <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, and provides <span
class="math inline">\(w = (A, k)\)</span> as the private input to <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. They take the public input, the
current set of verified proof-of-humanity profiles <span
class="math inline">\(\{H_1 ... H_n\}\)</span>, from the chain. They run
the ZK-SNARK proving algorithm, which (assuming the inputs are correct)
generates the proof. The prover sends the proof to the verifier and they
provide the block height at which they obtained the list of verified
profiles.</p>
<p>The verifier also reads the chain, gets the list <span
class="math inline">\(\{H_1 ... H_n\}\)</span> at the height that the
prover specified, and checks the proof. If the check passes, the
verifier is convinced that the prover has <em>some</em> verified
proof-of-humanity profile.</p>
<p><strong>Before we move on to more complicated examples, I highly
recommend you go over the above example until you understand every bit
of what is going on.</strong></p>
<h2 id="making-the-proof-of-membership-more-efficient">Making the
proof-of-membership more efficient</h2>
<p>One weakness in the above proof system is that the verifier needs to
know the whole set of profiles <span class="math inline">\(\{H_1 ...
H_n\}\)</span>, and they need to spend <span
class="math inline">\(O(n)\)</span> time "inputting" this set into the
ZK-SNARK mechanism.</p>
<p>We can solve this by instead passing in as a public input an on-chain
Merkle root containing <em>all</em> profiles (this could just be the
state root). We add another private input, a Merkle proof <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> proving that the prover's account <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is in the relevant part of the
tree.</p>

<p><em>Advanced readers: A very new and more efficient alternative to
Merkle proofs for ZK-proving membership is <a
href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/621">Caulk</a>. In the future, some
of these use cases may migrate to Caulk-like schemes.</em></p>
<h2 id="zk-snarks-for-coins">ZK-SNARKs for coins</h2>
<p>Projects like <a href="https://z.cash/">Zcash</a> and <a
href="https://tornado.cash">Tornado.cash</a> allow you to have
privacy-preserving <em>currency</em>. Now, you might think that you can
take the "ZK proof-of-humanity" above, but instead of proving access of
a proof-of-humanity profile, use it to prove access to a <em>coin</em>.
But we have a problem: we have to <em>simultaneously solve privacy and
the double spending problem</em>. That is, it should not be possible to
spend the coin twice.</p>
<p>Here's how we solve this. Anyone who has a coin has a private secret
<span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. They locally compute the "leaf"
<span class="math inline">\(L = hash(s, 1)\)</span>, which gets
published on-chain and becomes part of the state, and <span
class="math inline">\(N = hash(s, 2)\)</span>, which we call the
<em>nullifier</em>. The state gets stored in a Merkle tree.</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/using_snarks/coin.png"
class="padded" /></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>To spend a coin, the sender must make a ZK-SNARK where:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>public input</strong> contains a nullifier <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, the current or recent Merkle root
<span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, and a new leaf <span
class="math inline">\(L&#39;\)</span> (the intent is that recipient has
a secret <span class="math inline">\(s&#39;\)</span>, and passes to the
sender <span class="math inline">\(L&#39; = hash(s&#39;,
1)\)</span>)</li>
<li>The <strong>private input</strong> contains a secret <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, a leaf <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> and a Merkle branch <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span></li>
<li>The <strong>verification function</strong> checks that:
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is a valid Merkle branch
proving that <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is a leaf in a tree
with root <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is the current Merkle root of the
state</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(hash(s, 1) = L\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(hash(s, 2) = N\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The transaction contains the nullifier <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and the new leaf <span
class="math inline">\(L&#39;\)</span>. We don't actually prove anything
about <span class="math inline">\(L&#39;\)</span>, but we "mix it in" to
the proof to prevent <span class="math inline">\(L&#39;\)</span> from
being modified by third parties when the transaction is in-flight.</p>
<p>To verify the transaction, the chain checks the ZK-SNARK, and
additionally checks that <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> has not
been used in a previous spending transaction. If the transaction
succeeds, <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is added to the spent
nullifier set, so that it cannot be spent again. <span
class="math inline">\(L&#39;\)</span> is added to the Merkle tree.</p>
<p>What is going on here? We are using a zk-SNARK to relate two values,
<span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> (which goes on-chain when a coin
is created) and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> (which goes
on-chain when a coin is spent), without revealing <em>which</em> <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is connected to <em>which</em> <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. The connection between <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> can only be discovered if you know the
secret <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> that generates both. Each
coin that gets created can only be spent once (because for each <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> there is only one valid corresponding
<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>), but <em>which</em> coin is
being spent at a particular time is kept hidden.</p>
<p><strong>This is also an important primitive to understand. Many of
the mechanisms we describe below will be based on a very similar
"privately spend only once" gadget, though for different
purposes.</strong></p>
<h2 id="coins-with-arbitrary-balances">Coins with arbitrary
balances</h2>
<p>The above can easily be extended to coins of arbitrary balances. We
keep the concept of "coins", except each coin has a (private) balance
attached. One simple way to do this is have the chain store for each
coin not just the leaf <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> but also
an encrypted balance.</p>
<p>Each transaction would consume <em>two</em> coins and create two new
coins, and it would add two (leaf, encrypted balance) pairs to the
state. The ZK-SNARK would also check that the sum of the balances coming
in equals the sum of the balances going out, and that the two output
balances are both non-negative.</p>
<h2 id="zk-anti-denial-of-service">ZK anti-denial-of-service</h2>
<p>An interesting anti-<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">denial-of-service</a>
gadget. Suppose that you have some on-chain identity that is non-trivial
to create: it could be a proof-of-humanity profile, it could be a
validator with 32 ETH, or it could just be an account that has a nonzero
ETH balance. We could create a more DoS resistant peer-to-peer network
by only accepting a message if it comes with a proof that the message's
sender has such a profile. Every profile would be allowed to send up to
1000 messages per hour, and a sender's profile would be removed from the
list if the sender cheats. But how do we make this
privacy-preserving?</p>
<p>First, the setup. Let <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> be the
private key of a user; <span class="math inline">\(A =
privtoaddr(k)\)</span> is the corresponding address. The list of valid
addresses is public (eg. it's a registry on-chain). So far this is
similar to the proof-of-humanity example: you have to prove that you
have the private key to one address without revealing which one. But
here, we don't just want a proof that you're in the list. We want a
protocol that lets you prove you're in the list <em>but prevents you
from making too many proofs</em>. And so we need to do some more
work.</p>
<p>We'll divide up time into epochs; each epoch lasts 3.6 seconds (so,
1000 epochs per hour). Our goal will be to allow each user to send only
one message per epoch; if the user sends <em>two</em> messages in the
same epoch, they will get caught. To allow users to send occasional
bursts of messages, they are allowed to use epochs in the recent past,
so if some user has 500 unused epochs they can use those epochs to send
500 messages all at once.</p>
<h3 id="the-protocol">The protocol</h3>
<p>We'll start with a simple version: we use nullifiers. A user
generates a nullifier with <span class="math inline">\(N = hash(k,
e)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is their key
and <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> is the epoch number, and
publishes it along with the message <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. The ZK-SNARK once again mixes in <span
class="math inline">\(hash(m)\)</span> without verifying anything about
<span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, so that the proof is bound to a
single message. If a user makes two proofs bound to two different
messages with the same nullifier, they can get caught.</p>
<p>Now, we'll move on to the more complex version. Instead of just
making it easy to prove if someone used the same epoch twice, this next
protocol will actually <em>reveal their private key</em> in that case.
Our core technique will rely on the "two points make a line" trick: if
you reveal one point on a line, you've revealed little, but if you
reveal two points on a line, you've revealed the whole line.</p>
<p>For each epoch <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>, we take the
line <span class="math inline">\(L_e(x) = hash(k, e) * x + k\)</span>.
The slope of the line is <span class="math inline">\(hash(k,
e)\)</span>, and the y-intercept is <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>; neither is known to the public. To
make a <em>certificate</em> for a message <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, the sender provides <span
class="math inline">\(y = L_e(hash(m)) =\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(hash(k, e) * hash(m) + k\)</span>, along with a
ZK-SNARK proving that <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> was
computed correctly.</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/using_snarks/line.png"
class="padded" /></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>To recap, the ZK-SNARK here is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public input</strong>:
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\{A_1 ... A_n\}\)</span>, the list of
valid accounts</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, the message that the
certificate is verifying</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>, the epoch number used for
the certificate</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, the line function
evaluation</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Private input</strong>:
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, your private key</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Verification function</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Check that <span class="math inline">\(privtoaddr(k)\)</span> is in
<span class="math inline">\(\{A_1 ... A_n\}\)</span></li>
<li>Check that <span class="math inline">\(y = hash(k, e) * hash(m) +
k\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>But what if someone uses a single epoch twice? That means they
published two values <span class="math inline">\(m_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(m_2\)</span> and the corresponding certificate
values <span class="math inline">\(y_1 = hash(k, e) * hash(m_1) +
k\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y_2 = hash(k, e) * hash(m_2)
+ k\)</span>. We can use the two points to recover the line, and hence
the y-intercept (which is the private key):</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(k = y_1 - hash(m_1) * \frac{y_2 -
y_1}{hash(m_2) - hash(m_1)}\)</span></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>So if someone reuses an epoch, they leak out their private key for
everyone to see. Depending on the circumstance, this could imply stolen
funds, a slashed validator, or simply the private key getting
broadcasted and included into a smart contract, at which point the
corresponding address would get removed from the set.</p>
<p>What have we accomplished here? A viable off-chain, anonymous
anti-denial-of-service system useful for systems like blockchain
peer-to-peer networks, chat applications, etc, without requiring any
proof of work. The <a
href="https://medium.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/rate-limiting-nullifier-a-spam-protection-mechanism-for-anonymous-environments-bbe4006a57d">RLN
(rate limiting nullifier)</a> project is currently building essentially
this idea, though with minor modifications (namely, they do
<em>both</em> the nullifier and the two-points-on-a-line technique,
using the nullifier to make it easier to catch double-use of an
epoch).</p>
<h2 id="zk-negative-reputation">ZK negative reputation</h2>
<p>Suppose that we want to build <strong>0chan</strong>, an internet
forum which provides full anonymity like 4chan (so you don't even have
persistent names), but has a reputation system to encourage more quality
content. This could be a system where some moderation DAO can flag posts
as violating the rules of the system and institutes a
three-strikes-and-you're-out mechanism, it could be users being able to
upvote and downvote posts; there are lots of configurations.</p>
<p>The reputation system could support positive or negative reputation;
however, supporting negative reputation requires extra infrastructure to
<em>require</em> the user to take into account all reputation messages
in their proof, even the negative ones. It's this harder use case, which
is similar to what is being implemented with <a
href="https://unirep.gitbook.io/unirep-social/">Unirep Social</a>, that
we'll focus on.</p>
<h3 id="chaining-posts-the-basics">Chaining posts: the basics</h3>
<p>Anyone can make a post by publishing a message on-chain that contains
the post, and a ZK-SNARK proving that either (i) you own some scarce
external identity, eg. proof-of-humanity, that entitles you to create an
account, or (ii) that you made some specific previous post.
Specifically, the ZK-SNARK is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public inputs</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The nullifier <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span></li>
<li>A recent blockchain state root <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span></li>
<li>The post contents ("mixed in" to the proof to bind it to the post,
but we don't do any computation on it)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Private inputs</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Your private key <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span></li>
<li>Either an external identity (with address <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>), or the nullifier <span
class="math inline">\(N_{prev}\)</span> used by the previous post</li>
<li>A Merkle proof <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> proving
inclusion of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(N_{prev}\)</span> on-chain</li>
<li>The number <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> of posts that you
have previously made with this account</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Verification function</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Check that <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is a valid Merkle
branch proving that (either <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> or
<span class="math inline">\(N_{prev}\)</span>, whichever is provided) is
a leaf in a tree with root <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span></li>
<li>Check that <span class="math inline">\(N = enc(i, k)\)</span>, where
<span class="math inline">\(enc\)</span> is an encryption function (eg.
AES)</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(i = 0\)</span>, check that <span
class="math inline">\(A = privtoaddr(k)\)</span>, otherwise check that
<span class="math inline">\(N_{prev} = enc(i-1, k)\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to verifying the proof, the chain also checks that (i)
<span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> actually is a recent state root,
and (ii) the nullifier <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> has not
yet been used. So far, this is like the privacy-preserving coin
introduced earlier, but we add a procedure for "minting" a new account,
and we remove the ability to "send" your account to a different key -
instead, all nullifiers are generated using your original key.</p>
<p>We use <span class="math inline">\(enc\)</span> instead of <span
class="math inline">\(hash\)</span> here to make the nullifiers
reversible: if you have <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, you can
decrypt any specific nullifier you see on-chain and if the result is a
valid index and not random junk (eg. we could just check <span
class="math inline">\(dec(N) &lt; 2^{64}\)</span>), then you know that
nullifier was generated using <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="adding-reputation">Adding reputation</h3>
<p>Reputation in this scheme is on-chain and in the clear: some smart
contract has a method <code>addReputation</code>, which takes as input
(i) the nullifier published along with the post, and (ii) the number of
reputation units to add and subtract.</p>
<p>We extend the on-chain data stored per post: instead of just storing
the nullifier <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, we store <span
class="math inline">\(\{N, \bar{h}, \bar{u}\}\)</span>, where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\bar{h} = hash(h, r)\)</span> where
<span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is the block height of the state
root that was referenced in the proof</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\bar{u} = hash(u, r)\)</span> where
<span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is the account's reputation score
(0 for a fresh account)</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> here is simply a random value,
added to prevent <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> from being uncovered by brute-force
search (in cryptography jargon, adding <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> makes the hash a <em>hiding
commitment</em>).</p>
<p>Suppose that a post uses a root <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> and stores <span
class="math inline">\(\{N, \bar{h}, \bar{u}\}\)</span>. In the proof, it
links to a previous post, with stored data <span
class="math inline">\(\{N_{prev}, \bar{h}_{prev},
\bar{u}_{prev}\}\)</span>. The post's proof is also required to walk
over all the reputation entries that have been published between <span
class="math inline">\(h_{prev}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(h\)</span>. For each nullifier <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, the verification function would
decrypt <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> using the user's key
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, and if the decryption outputs a
valid index it would apply the reputation update. If the sum of all
reputation updates is <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>, the
proof would finally check <span class="math inline">\(u = u_{prev} +
\delta\)</span>.</p>

<p>If we want a "three strikes and you're out" rule, the ZK-SNARK would
also check <span class="math inline">\(u &gt; -3\)</span>. If we want a
rule where a post can get a special "high-reputation poster" flag if the
poster has <span class="math inline">\(\ge 100\)</span> rep, we can
accommodate that by adding "is <span class="math inline">\(u \ge
100\)</span>?" as a public input. Many kinds of such rules can be
accommodated.</p>
<p>To increase the scalability of the scheme, we could split it up into
two kinds of messages: <em>posts</em> and <em>reputation update
acknowledgements</em> (RCAs). A post would be off-chain, though it would
be required to point to an RCA made in the past week. RCAs would be
on-chain, and an RCA would walk through all the reputation updates since
that poster's previous RCA. This way, the on-chain load is reduced to
one transaction per poster per week plus one transaction per reputation
message (a very low level if reputation updates are rare, eg. they're
only used for moderation actions or perhaps "post of the day" style
prizes).</p>
<h2 id="holding-centralized-parties-accountable">Holding centralized
parties accountable</h2>
<p>Sometimes, you need to build a scheme that has a central "operator"
of some kind. This could be for many reasons: sometimes it's for
scalability, and sometimes it's for privacy - specifically, the privacy
of data held by the operator.</p>
<p>The <a
href="https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci">MACI</a>
coercion-resistant voting system, for example, requires voters to submit
their votes on-chain encrypted to a secret key held by a central
operator. The operator would decrypt all the votes on-chain, count them
up, and reveal the final result, along with a ZK-SNARK proving that they
did everything correctly. This extra complexity is necessary to ensure a
strong privacy property (called <strong>coercion-resistance</strong>):
that users cannot prove to others how they voted <em>even if they wanted
to</em>.</p>
<p>Thanks to blockchains and ZK-SNARKs, the amount of trust in the
operator can be kept very low. A malicious operator could still break
coercion resistance, but because votes are published on the blockchain,
the operator cannot cheat by censoring votes, and because the operator
must provide a ZK-SNARK, they cannot cheat by mis-calculating the
result.</p>
<h2 id="combining-zk-snarks-with-mpc">Combining ZK-SNARKs with MPC</h2>
<p>A more advanced use of ZK-SNARKs involves making proofs over
computations where the inputs are split between two or more parties, and
we don't want each party to learn the other parties' inputs. You can
satisfy the privacy requirement with <a
href="../../../2020/03/21/garbled.html">garbled circuits</a> in the
2-party case, and more complicated multi-party computation protocols in
the N-party case. ZK-SNARKs can be combined with these protocols to do
verifiable multi-party computation.</p>
<p>This could enable more advanced reputation systems where multiple
participants can perform joint computations over their private inputs,
it could enable privacy-preserving but authenticated data markets, and
many other applications. That said, note that the math for doing this
efficiently is still relatively in its infancy.</p>
<h2 id="what-cant-we-make-private">What can't we make private?</h2>
<p>ZK-SNARKs are generally very effective for creating systems where
users have private state. <strong>But ZK-SNARKs cannot hold private
state that <em>nobody</em> knows.</strong> To make a proof about a piece
of information, the prover has to know that piece of information in
cleartext.</p>
<p>A simple example of what can't (easily) be made private is Uniswap.
In Uniswap, there is a single <a
href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274">logically-central</a>
"thing", the market maker account, which belongs to no one, and every
single trade on Uniswap is trading against the market maker account. You
can't hide the state of the market maker account, because then someone
would have to hold the state in cleartext to make proofs, and their
active involvement would be necessary in every single transaction.</p>
<p>You <em>could</em> make a centrally-operated, but safe and private,
Uniswap with ZK-SNARKed garbled circuits, but it's not clear that the
benefits of doing this are worth the costs. There may not even be any
real benefit: the contract would need to be able to tell users what the
prices of the assets are, and the block-by-block changes in the prices
tell a lot about what the trading activity is.</p>
<p>Blockchains can make state information <em>global</em>, ZK-SNARKs can
make state information <em>private</em>, but we don't really have any
good way to make state information <em>global and private</em> at the
same time.</p>
<p><em>Edit: you can use multi-party computation to implement shared
private state. But this requires an honest-majority threshold
assumption, and one that's likely unstable in practice because (unlike
eg. with 51% attacks) a malicious majority could collude to break the
privacy without ever being detected.</em></p>
<h2 id="putting-the-primitives-together">Putting the primitives
together</h2>
<p>In the sections above, we've seen some examples that are powerful and
useful tools by themselves, but they are also intended to serve as
building blocks in other applications. Nullifiers, for example, are
important for currency, but it turns out that they pop up again and
again in all kinds of use cases.</p>
<p>The "forced chaining" technique used in the negative reputation
section is very broadly applicable. It's effective for many applications
where users have complex "profiles" that change in complex ways over
time, and you want to force the users to follow the rules of the system
while preserving privacy so no one sees which user is performing which
action. Users could even be required to have entire private Merkle trees
representing their internal "state". The "commitment pool" gadget <a
href="../../../2022/06/12/nonfin.html#common-knowledge">proposed in this
post</a> could be built with ZK-SNARKs. And if some application can't be
entirely on-chain and must have a centralized operator, the exact same
techniques can be used to keep the operator honest too.</p>
<p>ZK-SNARKs are a really powerful tool for combining together the
benefits of accountability and privacy. They do have their limits,
though in some cases clever application design can work around those
limits. I expect to see many more applications using ZK-SNARKs, and
eventually applications combining ZK-SNARKs with other forms of
cryptography, to be built in the years to come.</p>
