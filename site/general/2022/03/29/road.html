<title> The roads not taken </title>

<p>The Ethereum protocol development community has made a lot of
decisions in the early stages of Ethereum that have had a large impact
on the project's trajectory. In some cases, Ethereum developers made
conscious decisions to improve in some place where we thought that
Bitcoin erred. In other places, we were creating something new entirely,
and we simply had to come up with <em>something</em> to fill in a blank
- but there were many somethings to choose from. And in still other
places, we had a tradeoff between something more complex and something
simpler. Sometimes, we chose the simpler thing, but sometimes, we chose
the more complex thing too.</p>
<p>This post will look at some of these forks-in-the-road as I remember
them. Many of these features were seriously discussed within core
development circles; others were barely considered at all but perhaps
really should have been. But even still, it's worth looking at what a
different Ethereum might have looked like, and what we can learn from
this going forward.</p>
<h2
id="should-we-have-gone-with-a-much-simpler-version-of-proof-of-stake">Should
we have gone with a much simpler version of proof of stake?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03052">Gasper</a> proof of
stake that Ethereum is very soon going to merge to is a complex system,
but a very powerful system. Some of its properties include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Very strong single-block confirmations</strong> - as soon as
a transaction gets included in a block, <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/high-confidence-single-block-confirmations-in-casper-ffg/8909">usually</a>
within a few seconds that block gets solidified to the point that it
cannot be reverted unless either a large fraction of nodes are dishonest
or there is extreme network latency.</li>
<li><strong>Economic finality</strong> - once a block gets
<em>finalized</em>, it cannot be reverted without the attacker having to
lose millions of ETH to being slashed.</li>
<li><strong>Very predictable rewards</strong> - validators reliably earn
rewards every epoch (6.4 minutes), reducing incentives to pool</li>
<li><strong>Support for very high validator count</strong> - unlike most
other chains with the above features, the Ethereum beacon chain supports
<em>hundreds of thousands</em> of validators (eg. Tendermint offers even
faster finality than Ethereum, but it <a
href="https://forum.cosmos.network/t/performance-of-tendermint-in-case-of-large-number-of-nodes/3442/2">only
supports a few hundred</a> validators)</li>
</ul>
<p>But making a system that has these properties is <em>hard</em>. It
took <a
href="https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1029900695925706753">years
of research</a>, years of <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/research/tree/master/casper4">failed</a>
<a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/casper/blob/master/casper/contracts/simple_casper.v.py">experiments</a>,
and generally took a huge amount of effort. And the final output was
pretty complex.</p>

<p>If our researchers did not have to worry so much about consensus and
had more brain cycles to spare, then maybe, just maybe, <a
href="../../../2021/01/05/rollup.html">rollups</a> could have been
invented in 2016. This brings us to a question: <strong>should we really
have had such high standards for our proof of stake, when even a much
simpler and weaker version of proof of stake would have been a large
improvement over the proof of work status quo?</strong></p>
<p>Many have the misconception that proof of stake is <a
href="https://www.lynalden.com/proof-of-stake/">inherently complex</a>,
but in reality there are plenty of proof of stake algorithms that are
almost as simple as Nakamoto PoW. <a
href="https://nxtdocs.jelurida.com/Nxt_Whitepaper#:~:text=Nxt%20is%20a%20100%25%20proof,called%20nothing%20at%20stake%20attacks.">NXT
proof of stake</a> existed since 2013 and would have been a natural
candidate; it had issues but those issues could easily have been
patched, and we could have had a reasonably well-working proof of stake
from 2017, or even from the beginning. The reason why Gasper is more
complex than these algorithms is simply that it <em>tries to accomplish
much more than they do</em>. But if we had been more modest at the
beginning, we could have focused on achieving a more limited set of
objectives first.</p>
<p>Proof of stake from the beginning would in my opinion have been a
mistake; PoW was helpful in expanding the initial <a
href="https://etherscan.io/stat/supply">issuance distribution</a> and
making Ethereum accessible, as well as encouraging a hobbyist community.
But switching to a simpler proof of stake in 2017, or even 2020, could
have led to much less environmental damage (and anti-crypto mentality as
a result of environmental damage) and a lot more research talent being
free to think about scaling. Would we have had to spend a lot of
resources on making a better proof of stake eventually? Yes. But it's
increasingly looking like we'll <a
href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/single_slot_finality">end up
doing that anyway</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-de-complexification-of-sharding">The de-complexification of
sharding</h2>
<p>Ethereum sharding has been on a very consistent trajectory of
becoming less and less complex since the ideas started being <a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/09/17/scalability-part-1-building-top/">worked
on in 2014</a>. First, we had complex sharding with built-in execution
and cross-shard transactions. Then, we simplified the protocol by moving
more responsibilities to the user (eg. in a cross-shard transaction, the
user would have to separately pay for gas on both shards). Then, we
switched to the <a
href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698">rollup-centric
roadmap</a> where, from the protocol's point of view, shards are just
blobs of data. Finally, with <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9oudTr5BE4">danksharding</a>, the
shard fee markets are merged into one, and the final design just looks
like a non-sharded chain but where some data availability sampling magic
happens behind the scenes to make sharded verification happen.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>But what if we had gone the opposite path? Well, there actually are
Ethereum researchers who <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lC-CNzWllKA">heavily explored</a>
a much more sophisticated sharding system: shards would be chains, there
would be fork choice rules where child chains depend on parent chains,
cross-shard messages would get routed by the protocol, validators would
be rotated between shards, and even applications would get automatically
load-balanced between shards!</p>
<p>The problem with that approach: those forms of sharding are largely
just ideas and mathematical models, whereas Danksharding is a complete
and almost-ready-for-implementation <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs#sharding">spec</a>.
Hence, given Ethereum's circumstances and constraints, the
simplification and de-ambitionization of sharding was, in my opinion,
absolutely the right move. That said, the more ambitious research also
has a very important role to play: it identifies promising research
directions, even the very complex ideas often have "reasonably simple"
versions of those ideas that still provide a lot of benefits, and
there's a good chance that it will significantly influence Ethereum's
protocol development (or even layer-2 protocols) over the years to
come.</p>
<h2 id="more-or-less-features-in-the-evm">More or less features in the
EVM?</h2>
<p>Realistically, the specification of the EVM was basically, with the
exception of security auditing, viable for launch by mid-2014. However,
over the next few months we continued actively exploring new features
that we felt might be really important for a decentralized application
blockchain. Some did not go in, others did.</p>
<ul>
<li>We <strong>considered <a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/08/27/state-ethereum-august-edition/">adding
a <code>POST</code> opcode</a>, but decided against it.</strong> The
<code>POST</code> opcode would have made an <em>asynchronous</em> call,
that would get executed after the rest of the transaction finishes.</li>
<li>We <strong>considered <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/117">adding an
<code>ALARM</code> opcode</a>, but decided against it.</strong>
<code>ALARM</code> would have functioned like <code>POST</code>, except
executing the asynchronous call in some future block, allowing contracts
to schedule operations.</li>
<li>We <strong>added <a
href="https://medium.com/mycrypto/understanding-event-logs-on-the-ethereum-blockchain-f4ae7ba50378">logs</a></strong>,
which allow contracts to output records that do not touch the state, but
could be interpreted by dapp interfaces and wallets. Notably, we also
<strong>considered making ETH transfers emit a log, but decided against
it</strong> - the rationale being that "people will soon switch to smart
contract wallets anyway".</li>
<li>We <strong>considered expanding <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/97">SSTORE to support byte
arrays</a>, but decided against it</strong>, because of concerns about
complexity and safety.</li>
<li>We <strong>added <a
href="https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/15479/list-of-pre-compiled-contracts">precompiles</a></strong>,
contracts which execute specialized cryptographic operations with native
implementations at a much cheaper gas cost than can be done in the
EVM.</li>
<li>In the months right after launch, <strong>state rent was <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/35">considered</a> <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/88">again</a> and <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/87">again</a>, but was
never included</strong>. It was just too complicated. Today, there are
much better <a
href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/state_expiry_eip">state
expiry schemes</a> being actively explored, though <a
href="https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2021/02/14/why-stateless.html">stateless
verification</a> and <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/two-slot-proposer-builder-separation/10980">proposer/builder
separation</a> mean that it is now a much lower priority.</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at this today, most of the decisions to <em>not</em> add more
features have proven to be very good decisions. There was no obvious
reason to add a <code>POST</code> opcode. An <code>ALARM</code> opcode
is actually very difficult to implement safely: what happens if everyone
in blocks 1...99999 sets an <code>ALARM</code> to execute a lot of code at
block 100000? Will that block take hours to process? Will some scheduled
operations get pushed back to later blocks? But if that happens, then
what guarantees is <code>ALARM</code> even preserving?
<code>SSTORE</code> for byte arrays is difficult to do safely, and would
have greatly expanded worst-case witness sizes.</p>
<p>The state rent issue is more challenging: had we actually implemented
some kind of state rent from day 1, we would not have had a smart
contract ecosystem evolve around a normalized assumption of persistent
state. Ethereum would have been harder to build for, but it could have
been more scalable and sustainable. At the same time, the state expiry
schemes we had back then really were much worse than <a
href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/state_expiry_eip">what we
have now</a>. Sometimes, good ideas just take years to arrive at and
there is no better way around that.</p>
<h3 id="alternative-paths-for-log">Alternative paths for
<code>LOG</code></h3>
<p><code>LOG</code> could have been done differently in two different
ways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>We could have made ETH transfers auto-issue a
<code>LOG</code></strong>. This would have saved a <em>lot</em> of
effort and software bug issues for exchanges and many other users, and
would have accelerated everyone relying on logs that would have
ironically <em>helped</em> smart contract wallet adoption.</li>
<li><strong>We could have not bothered with a <code>LOG</code>
<em>opcode</em> at all</strong>, and instead made it an ERC: there would
be a standard contract that has a function <code>submitLog</code> and
uses the <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/deposit-contract.md#solidity-code">technique
from the Ethereum deposit contract</a> to compute a Merkle root of all
logs in that block. Either <a
href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2929">EIP-2929</a> or
block-scoped storage (equivalent to <a
href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1153">TSTORE</a> but cleared
after the block) would have made this cheap.</li>
</ol>
<p>We strongly considered (1), but rejected it. The main reason was
simplicity: it's easier for logs to <em>just</em> come from the
<code>LOG</code> opcode. We also (very wrongly!) expected most users to
quickly migrate to smart contract wallets, which could have logged
transfers explicitly using the opcode.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>was not considered, but in retrospect it was always an option. The
main downside of (2) would have been the lack of a Bloom filter
mechanism for quickly scanning for logs. But as it turns out, the Bloom
filter mechanism is too slow to be user-friendly for dapps anyway, and
so these days more and more people <a
href="https://thegraph.com/en/">use TheGraph</a> for querying
anyway.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the whole, it seems very possible that <em>either one</em> of
these approaches would have been superior to the status quo. Keeping
<code>LOG</code> outside the protocol would have kept things simpler,
but if it was inside the protocol auto-logging all ETH transfers would
have made it <em>more useful</em>.</p>
<p>Today, I would probably favor the eventual abolition of the
<code>LOG</code> opcode from the EVM.</p>
<h3 id="what-if-the-evm-was-something-totally-different">What if the EVM
was something totally different?</h3>
<p>There were two natural very different paths that the EVM could have
taken:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Make the EVM be a <strong>higher-level language</strong>, with
built-in constructs for variables, if-statements, loops, etc.</li>
<li>Make the EVM be a <strong>copy of some existing VM</strong> (LLVM,
WASM, etc)</li>
</ol>
<p>The first path was never really considered. The attraction of this
path is that it could have made compilers simpler, and allowed more
developers to code in EVM directly. It could have also made ZK-EVM
constructions simpler. The weakness of the path is that it would have
made EVM code <em>structurally</em> more complicated: instead of being a
simple list of opcodes in a row, it would have been a more complicated
data structure that would have had to be stored somehow. That said,
there was a missed opportunity for a best-of-both-worlds: some EVM
changes could have given us a lot of those benefits while keeping the
basic EVM structure roughly as is: <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/aleth/issues/3404">ban dynamic jumps
and add some opcodes designed to support subroutines</a> (see also: <a
href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2315">EIP-2315</a>), allow
memory access only on 32-byte word boundaries, etc.</p>
<p>The second path was suggested many times, and rejected many times.
The usual argument for it is that it would allow programs to compile
from existing languages (C, Rust, etc) into the EVM. The argument
against has always been that given Ethereum's unique constraints it
would not actually provide any benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Existing compilers from high-level languages tend to not care about
total code size, whereas blockchain code must optimize heavily to cut
down every byte of code size</li>
<li>We need multiple implementations of the VM with a hard requirement
that two implementations <em>never</em> process the same code
differently. Security-auditing and verifying this on code that we did
not write would be much harder.</li>
<li>If the VM specification changes, Ethereum would have to either
always update along with it or fall more and more out-of-sync.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, there probably was never a viable path for the EVM that's
<em>radically</em> different from what we have today, though there are
lots of smaller details (jumps, 64 vs 256 bit, etc) that could have led
to much better outcomes if they were done differently.</p>
<h2 id="should-the-eth-supply-have-been-distributed-differently">Should
the ETH supply have been distributed differently?</h2>
<p>The current ETH supply is approximately represented by this <a
href="https://etherscan.io/stat/supply">chart from Etherscan</a>:</p>
<center>
<p><img src="../../../../images/road/supplychart.png"
class="padded" /></p>
</center>
<p>About half of the ETH that exists today was sold in an open public <a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/22/launching-the-ether-sale/">ether
sale</a>, where anyone could send BTC to a standardized bitcoin address,
and the initial ETH supply distribution was computed by an <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/genesis_block_generator/blob/master/mk_genesis_block.py">open-source
script</a> that scans the Bitcoin blockchain for transactions going to
that address. Most of the remainder was mined. The slice at the bottom,
the 12M ETH marked "other", was the "premine" - a piece distributed
between the Ethereum Foundation and ~100 early contributors to the
Ethereum protocol.</p>
<p>There are two main criticisms of this process:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The premine, as well as the fact that the Ethereum
Foundation received the sale funds, is not <a
href="https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/">credibly
neutral</a></strong>. A few recipient addresses were hand-picked through
a closed process, and the Ethereum Foundation had to be trusted to not
take out loans to recycle funds received furing the sale back into the
sale to give itself more ETH (we did not, and no one seriously claims
that we have, but even the requirement to be trusted at all offends
some).</li>
<li><strong>The premine over-rewarded very early contributors, and left
too little for later contributors</strong>. 75% of the premine went to
rewarding contributors for their work before launch, and post-launch the
Ethereum Foundation only had 3 million ETH left. Within 6 months, the
need to sell to financially survive decreased that to around 1 million
ETH.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a way, the problems were related: the desire to minimize
perceptions of centralization contributed to a smaller premine, and a
smaller premine was exhausted more quickly.</p>
<p>This is not the only way that things could have been done. <a
href="https://z.cash/">Zcash</a> has a different approach: a constant
20% of the block reward goes to a set of recipients hard-coded in the
protocol, and the set of recipients gets re-negotiated every 4 years (so
far this has <a
href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/dev-fund-poll-shows-consensus/">happened
once</a>). This would have been much more sustainable, but it would have
been much more heavily criticized as centralized (the Zcash community
seems to be more openly okay with more technocratic leadership than the
Ethereum community).</p>
<p>One possible alternative path would be something similar to the "DAO
from day 1" route popular among some defi projects today. Here is a
possible strawman proposal:</p>
<ul>
<li>We agree that for 2 years, a block reward of <strong>2 ETH per block
goes into a dev fund</strong>.</li>
<li>Anyone who purchases ETH in the ether sale could specify a
<strong>vote for their preferred distribution</strong> of the dev fund
(eg. "1 ETH per block to the Ethereum Foundation, 0.4 ETH to the
Consensys research team, 0.2 ETH to Vlad Zamfir...")</li>
<li><strong>Recipients that got voted for get a share from the dev
fund</strong> equal to the <strong>median of everyone's votes</strong>,
scaled so that the total equals 2 ETH per block (median is to prevent
self-dealing: if you vote for yourself you get nothing unless you get at
least half of other purchasers to mention you)</li>
</ul>
<p>The sale could be run by a legal entity that promises to distribute
the <em>bitcoin</em> received during the sale along the same ratios as
the ETH dev fund (or burned, if we really wanted to make bitcoiners
happy). This probably would have led to the Ethereum Foundation getting
a lot of funding, non-EF groups also getting a lot of funding (leading
to more ecosystem decentralization), all without breaking credible
neutrality one single bit. The main downside is of course that <a
href="../../../2021/08/16/voting3.html">coin voting really sucks</a>,
but pragmatically we could have realized that 2014 was still an early
and idealistic time and the most serious downsides of coin voting would
only start coming into play long after the sale ends.</p>
<p>Would this have been a better idea and set a better precedent? Maybe!
Though realistically even if the dev fund had been fully credibly
neutral, the people who yell about Ethereum's premine today may well
have just started yelling twice as hard about the DAO fork instead.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-we-learn-from-all-this">What can we learn from all
this?</h2>
<p>In general, <strong>it sometimes feels to me like Ethereum's biggest
challenges come from balancing between two visions - a pure and simple
blockchain that values safety and simplicity, and a highly performant
and functional platform for building advanced applications</strong>.
Many of the examples above are just aspects of this: do we have fewer
features and be more Bitcoin-like, or more features and be more
developer-friendly? Do we worry a lot about making development funding
credibly neutral and be more Bitcoin-like, or do we just worry first and
foremost about making sure devs are rewarded enough to make Ethereum
great?</p>
<p><strong>My personal dream is to try to achieve both visions at the
same time</strong> - a base layer where the specification becomes
<em>smaller</em> each year than the year before it, and a powerful
developer-friendly advanced application ecosystem centered around
layer-2 protocols. That said, getting to such an ideal world takes a
long time, and <strong>a more explicit realization that it would take
time and we need to think about the roadmap step-by-step would have
probably helped us a lot.</strong></p>
<p>Today, there are a lot of things we cannot change, but there are many
things that we still can, and there is still a path solidly open to
improving both functionality and simplicity. Sometimes the path is a
winding one: we need to add some more complexity first to enable
sharding, which in turn enables lots of layer-2 scalability on top. That
said, reducing complexity is possible, and Ethereum's history has
already demonstrated this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-150">EIP-150</a> made
the call stack depth limit no longer relevant, reducing security worries
for contract developers.</li>
