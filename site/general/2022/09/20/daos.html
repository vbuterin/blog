<title> DAOs are not corporations: where decentralization in autonomous organizations matters </title>

<p><em>Special thanks to Karl Floersch and Tina Zhen for feedback and
review on earlier versions of this article.</em></p>
<p>Recently, there has been a lot of <a
href="https://twitter.com/0xSisyphus/status/1545113732585558018">discourse</a>
around the <a
href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2022/03/31/enhancing-traditional-corporate-governance-with-daos/?sh=103f87c46256">idea</a>
that highly decentralized DAOs <a
href="https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1528740714145890304">do not
work</a>, and DAO governance <a
href="https://graymirror.substack.com/p/optimal-autonomous-organizations">should</a>
start to <a
href="https://twitter.com/verbine/status/1315959108684722176">more
closely resemble</a> that of <a
href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/why-daos-token-based-governance-is-a-fantasy.htm">traditional
corporations</a> in order to remain competitive. The argument is always
similar: highly decentralized governance is inefficient, and traditional
corporate governance structures with boards, CEOs and the like evolved
over hundreds of years to optimize for the goal of making good decisions
and delivering value to shareholders in a changing world. DAO idealists
are naive to assume that egalitarian ideals of decentralization can
outperform this, when attempts to do this in the traditional corporate
sector have had marginal success at best.</p>
<p>This post will argue why this position is often wrong, and offer a
different and more detailed perspective about where different kinds of
decentralization are important. In particular, I will focus on
<em>three</em> types of situations where decentralization is
important:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decentralization for making better decisions in concave
environments</strong>, where pluralism and even naive forms of
compromise are on average likely to outperform the kinds of coherency
and focus that come from centralization.</li>
<li><strong>Decentralization for censorship resistance</strong>:
applications that need to continue functioning while resisting attacks
from powerful external actors.</li>
<li><strong>Decentralization as credible fairness</strong>: applications
where DAOs are taking on nation-state-like functions like basic
infrastructure provision, and so traits like predictability, robustness
and neutrality are valued above efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<h2
id="centralization-is-convex-decentralization-is-concave">Centralization
is convex, decentralization is concave</h2>
<p><em>See the original post: <a
href="../../../2020/11/08/concave.html">../../../2020/11/08/concave.html</a></em></p>
<p>One way to categorize decisions that need to be made is to look at
whether they are <strong>convex</strong> or <strong>concave</strong>. In
a choice between A and B, we would first look not at the question of A
vs B itself, but instead at a higher-order question: would you rather
take a <em>compromise</em> between A and B or a <em>coin flip</em>? In
expected utility terms, we can express this distinction using a
graph:</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/daos/convex1.png" /></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>If a decision is concave, we would prefer a compromise, and if it's
convex, we would prefer a coin flip. Often, we can answer the
higher-order question of whether a compromise or a coin flip is better
much more easily than we can answer the first-order question of A vs B
itself.</p>
<p>Examples of convex decisions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pandemic response</strong>: a 100% travel ban may work at
keeping a virus out, a 0% travel ban won't stop viruses but at least
doesn't inconvenience people, but a 50% or 90% travel ban is the <a
href="https://mobile.twitter.com/lymanstoneky/status/1321254322064236544">worst
of both worlds</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Military strategy</strong>: attacking on front A may make
sense, attacking on front B may make sense, but splitting your army in
half and attacking at both just means the enemy can easily <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defeat_in_detail">deal with the two
halves one by one</a></li>
<li><strong>Technology choices in crypto protocols</strong>: using
technology A may make sense, using technology B may make sense, but some
hybrid between the two often just leads to needless complexity and even
adds risks of the two <a
href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/289.pdf">interfering with each
other</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of concave decisions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Judicial decisions</strong>: an average between two
independently chosen judgements is probably more likely to be fair, and
less likely to be completely ridiculous, than a random choice of one of
the two judgements.</li>
<li><strong>Public goods funding</strong>: usually, giving $X to each of
two promising projects is more effective than giving $2X to one and
nothing to the other. Having any money at all gives a much bigger boost
to a project's ability to achieve its mission than going from $X to $2X
does.</li>
<li><strong>Tax rates</strong>: because of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadweight_loss">quadratic
deadweight loss mechanics</a>, a tax rate of X% is often only a
<em>quarter</em> as harmful as a tax rate of 2X%, and at the same time
<em>more than half</em> as good at raising revenue. Hence, moderate
taxes are better than a coin flip between low/no taxes and high
taxes.</li>
</ul>
<p>When decisions are convex, decentralizing the process of making that
decision can easily lead to confusion and low-quality compromises. When
decisions are concave, on the other hand, relying on the wisdom of the
crowds can give <em>better</em> answers. In these cases, DAO-like
structures with large amounts of diverse input going into
decision-making can make a lot of sense. And indeed, people who see the
world as a more concave place <em>in general</em> are more likely to see
a need for decentralization in a wider variety of contexts.</p>
<h3 id="should-vitadao-and-ukraine-dao-be-daos">Should VitaDAO and
Ukraine DAO be DAOs?</h3>
<p>Many of the more recent DAOs differ from earlier DAOs, like MakerDAO,
in that whereas the earlier DAOs are organized around <em>providing
infrastructure</em>, the newer DAOs are organized around <em>performing
various tasks around a particular theme</em>. <a
href="https://vitadao.com">VitaDAO</a> is a DAO funding early-stage
longevity research, and <a href="https://ukrainedao.love">UkraineDAO</a>
is a DAO organizing and funding efforts related to helping Ukrainian
victims of war and supporting the Ukrainian defense effort. Does it make
sense for these to be DAOs?</p>
<p>This is a nuanced question, and we can get a view of one possible
answer by understanding the internal workings of UkraineDAO itself.
Typical DAOs tend to "decentralize" by gathering large amounts of
capital into a single pool and using token-holder voting to fund each
allocation. UkraineDAO, on the other hand, works by splitting its
functions up into <a
href="https://ukraine-dao.notion.site/Ukraine-DAO-Governance-eb34313505834095ad1d54e9f464e222">many
pods</a>, where each pod works as independently as possible. A top layer
of governance can create new pods (in principle, governance can also
fund pods, though so far funding has only gone to external
Ukraine-related organizations), but once a pod is made and endowed with
resources, it functions largely on its own. Internally, individual pods
do have leaders and function in a more centralized way, though they
still try to respect an ethos of personal autonomy.</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/daos/pods.png" /></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>One natural question that one might ask is: <strong>isn't this kind
of "DAO" just rebranding the traditional concept of multi-layer
hierarchy?</strong> I would say this depends on the implementation: it's
certainly possible to take this template and turn it into something that
feels authoritarian in the same way stereotypical large corporations do,
but it's also possible to use the template in a very different way.</p>
<p>Two things that can help ensure that an organization built this way
will actually turn out to be meaningfully decentralized include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A truly <strong>high level of autonomy for pods</strong>, where the
pods accept resources from the core and are occasionally checked for
alignment and competence if they want to keep getting those resources,
but otherwise act entirely on their own and don't "take orders" from the
core.</li>
<li><strong>Highly decentralized and diverse core governance</strong>.
This <a href="../../../2021/08/16/voting3.html">does not require a
"governance token"</a>, but it does require broader and more diverse
participation in the core. Normally, broad and diverse participation is
a large tax on efficiency. But if (1) is satisfied, so pods are highly
autonomous and the core needs to make fewer decisions, the effects of
top-level governance being less efficient become smaller.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, how does this fit into the "convex vs concave" framework? Here,
the answer is roughly as follows: <strong>the (more decentralized) top
level is concave, the (more centralized within each pod) bottom level is
convex</strong>. Giving a pod $X is generally better than a coin flip
between giving it $0 and giving it $2X, and there isn't a large loss
from having compromises or "inconsistent" philosophies guiding different
decisions. But within each individual pod, having a clear opinionated
perspective guiding decisions and being able to insist on many choices
that have synergies with each other is much more important.</p>
<h2 id="decentralization-and-censorship-resistance">Decentralization and
censorship resistance</h2>
<p>The most often publicly cited reason for decentralization in crypto
is censorship resistance: a DAO or protocol needs to be able to function
and defend itself despite external attack, including from large
corporate or even state actors. This has already been <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=censorship+resistance+decentralization">publicly
talked about at length</a>, and so deserves less elaboration, but there
are still some important nuances.</p>
<p>Two of the most successful censorship-resistant services that large
numbers of people use today are <a href="https://thepiratebay.org/">The
Pirate Bay</a> and <a href="https://sci-hub.se/">Sci-Hub</a>. The Pirate
Bay is a hybrid system: it's a search engine for BitTorrent, which is a
highly decentralized network, but the search engine itself is
centralized. It has a small core team that is dedicated to keeping it
running, and it defends itself with the mole's strategy in whack-a-mole:
when the hammer comes down, move out of the way and re-appear somewhere
else. The Pirate Bay and Sci-Hub have both frequently changed domain
names, relied on arbitrage between different jurisdictions, and used all
kinds of other techniques. This strategy is centralized, but it has
allowed them both to be successful <em>both</em> at defense and at
product-improvement agility.</p>
<p>DAOs do not act like The Pirate Bay and Sci-Hub; DAOs act like
BitTorrent. And <strong>there is a reason why BitTorrent <em>does</em>
need to be decentralized: it requires not just censorship resistance,
but also long-term investment and reliability</strong>. If BitTorrent
got shut down once a year and required all its seeders and users to
switch to a new provider, the network would quickly degrade in quality.
Censorship resistance-demanding DAOs should also be in the same
category: they should be providing a service that isn't just evading
permanent censorship, but also evading mere instability and disruption.
MakerDAO (and <a href="https://reflexer.finance/">the Reflexer DAO</a>
which manages RAI) are excellent examples of this. A DAO running a
decentralized search engine probably does not: you can just build a
regular search engine and use Sci-Hub-style techniques to ensure its
survival.</p>
<h2 id="decentralization-as-credible-fairness">Decentralization as
credible fairness</h2>
<p>Sometimes, DAOs' primary concern is not a need to <em>resist</em>
nation states, but rather a need to <em>take on some of the
functions</em> of nation states. This often involves tasks that can be
described as "maintaining basic infrastructure". Because governments
have less ability to oversee DAOs, DAOs need to be structured to take on
a greater ability to oversee <em>themselves</em>. And this requires
decentralization.</p>

<p><small><i>Of course, it's not actually possible to come anywhere
close to eliminating hierarchy and inequality of information and
decision-making power in its entirety etc etc etc, but what if we can
get even 30% of the way there?</i></small></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Consider three motivating examples: algorithmic stablecoins, the <a
href="https://kleros.io/">Kleros court</a>, and the <a
href="https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c">Optimism
retroactive funding mechanism</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>An algorithmic stablecoin DAO</strong> is a system that uses
on-chain financial contracts to create a crypto-asset whose price tracks
some stable index, often but not necessarily the US dollar.</li>
<li><strong>Kleros is a "<a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4gigyd/decentralized_court/">decentralized
court</a>"</strong>: a DAO whose function is to give rulings on
arbitration questions such as "is this Github commit an acceptable
submission to this on-chain bounty?"</li>
<li><strong>Optimism's retroactive funding mechanism</strong> is a
component of the <a
href="https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/">Optimism DAO</a>
which retroactively rewards projects that have provided value to the
Ethereum and Optimism ecosystems.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all three cases, there is a need to make subjective judgements,
which cannot be done automatically through a piece of on-chain code. In
the first case, the goal is simply to get reasonably accurate
measurements of some price index. If the stablecoin tracks the US
dollar, then you just need the ETH/USD price. If hyperinflation or some
other reason to abandon the US dollar arises, the stablecoin DAO might
need to manage a trustworthy on-chain CPI calculation. Kleros is all
about making unavoidably subjective judgements on any arbitrary question
that is submitted to it, including whether or not submitted questions
should be <a
href="https://snapshot.org/#/kleros.eth/proposal/QmeJjVUgF2o9vrmjx8szvher8Ca6iR2TuTwHGR9KbM1gC9">rejected
for being "unethical"</a>. Optimism's retroactive funding is tasked with
one of the most open-ended subjective questions at all: what projects
have done work that is the most useful to the Ethereum and Optimism
ecosystems?</p>
<p>All three cases have an unavoidable need for "governance", and pretty
robust governance too. In all cases, governance being attackable, from
the outside or the inside, can easily lead to very big problems.
Finally, the governance doesn't just need to <em>be</em> robust, it
needs to <em>credibly convince</em> a large and untrusting public that
it is robust.</p>
<h3 id="the-algorithmic-stablecoins-achilles-heel-the-oracle">The
algorithmic stablecoin's Achilles heel: the oracle</h3>
<p>Algorithmic stablecoins depend on oracles. In order for an on-chain
smart contract to know whether to target the value of DAI to 0.005 ETH
or 0.0005 ETH, it needs some mechanism to learn the
(external-to-the-chain) piece of information of what the ETH/USD price
is. And in fact, this "oracle" is the primary place at which an
algorithmic stablecoin can be attacked.</p>
<p>This leads to a security conundrum: an algorithmic stablecoin cannot
safely hold more collateral, and therefore cannot issue more units, than
the market cap of its speculative token (eg. MKR, FLX...), because if it
does, then it becomes profitable to buy up half the speculative token
supply, use those tokens to control the oracle, and steal funds from
users by feeding bad oracle values and liquidating them.</p>
<p>Here is a possible alternative design for a stablecoin oracle: <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/a-not-quite-cryptoeconomic-decentralized-oracle/6453">add
a layer of indirection</a>. Quoting the ethresear.ch post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We set up a contract where there are 13 "providers"; the answer to a
query is the median of the answer returned by these providers. Every
week, there is a vote, where the oracle token holders can replace one of
the providers ...</p>
<p>The security model is simple: if you trust the voting mechanism, you
can trust the oracle output, unless 7 providers get corrupted at the
same time. If you trust the current set of oracle providers, you can
trust the output for at least the next six weeks, even if you completely
do not trust the voting mechanism. Hence, if the voting mechanism gets
corrupted, there will be able time for participants in any applications
that depend on the oracle to make an orderly exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice the very un-corporate-like nature of this proposal. It
involves <em>taking away</em> the governance's ability to act quickly,
and intentionally spreading out oracle responsibility across a large
number of participants. This is valuable for two reasons. First, it
makes it harder for outsiders to attack the oracle, and for new coin
holders to quickly take over control of the oracle. Second, it makes it
harder for <em>the oracle participants themselves</em> to collude to
attack the system. It also mitigates <em>oracle extractable value</em>,
where a single provider might intentionally delay publishing to
personally profit from a liquidation (in a multi-provider system, if one
provider doesn't immediately publish, others soon will).</p>
<h3 id="fairness-in-kleros">Fairness in Kleros</h3>
<p>The "decentralized court" system Kleros is a really valuable and
important piece of infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem: <a
href="https://www.proofofhumanity.id/">Proof of Humanity</a> uses it,
various "smart contract bug insurance" products use it, and many other
projects plug into it as some kind of "adjudication of last resort".</p>
<p>Recently, there have been some public concerns about whether or not
the platform's decision-making is fair. Some participants have made
cases, trying to claim a payout from decentralized smart contract
insurance platforms that they argue they deserve. Perhaps the most
famous of these cases is <a
href="https://ipfs.kleros.io/ipfs/QmYr4e5jpNSjeUBw9BbM2G156eMmxcaMaknm17JHm8WP8G/1170-6a.pdf">Mizu's
report on case #1170</a>. The case blew up from being a minor language
intepretation dispute into a broader scandal because of the accusation
that insiders to Kleros itself were making a coordinated effort to throw
a large number of tokens to pushing the decision in the direction they
wanted. A participant to the debate writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The incentives-based decision-making process of the court ... is by all
appearances being corrupted by a single dev with a very large (25%)
stake in the courts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, this is but one side of one issue in a broader debate, and
it's up to the Kleros community to figure out who is right or wrong and
how to respond. But zooming out from the question of this individual
case, what is important here is the the extent to which the <em>entire
value proposition</em> of something like Kleros depends on it being able
to convince the public that it is strongly protected against this kind
of centralized manipulation. For something like Kleros to be trusted, it
seems necessary that there should not be a single individual with a 25%
stake in a high-level court. Whether through a more widely distributed
token supply, or through more use of non-token-driven governance, a more
credibly decentralized form of governance could help Kleros avoid such
concerns entirely.</p>
<h3 id="optimism-retro-funding">Optimism retro funding</h3>
<p>Optimism's <a href="../../../2021/11/16/retro1.html">retroactive
founding round 1</a> results were chosen by a quadratic vote among 24
"badge holders". Round 2 will likely use a larger number of badge
holders, and the eventual goal is to move to a system where <a
href="https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/">a much larger body
of citizens</a> control retro funding allocation, likely through some
multilayered mechanism involving sortition, subcommittees and/or
delegation.</p>
<p>There have been some internal debates about whether to have more vs
fewer citizens: should "citizen" <em>really</em> mean something closer
to "senator", an expert contributor who deeply understands the Optimism
ecosystem, should it be a position given out to <em>just about
anyone</em> who has significantly participated in the Optimism
ecosystem, or somewhere in between? <strong>My personal stance on this
issue has always been in the direction of more citizens, solving
governance inefficiency issues with second-layer delegation instead of
adding enshrined centralization into the governance protocol. One key
reason for my position is the potential for insider trading and
self-dealing issues</strong>.</p>
<p>The Optimism retroactive funding mechanism has always been intended
to be coupled with a <em>prospective</em> speculation ecosystem:
public-goods projects that need funding <em>now</em> could sell "project
tokens", and anyone who buys project tokens becomes eligible for a large
retroactively-funded compensation later. But this mechanism working well
depends crucially on the retroactive funding part working correctly, and
is <em>very</em> vulnerable to the retroactive funding mechanism
becoming corrupted. Some example attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>If some group of people has decided how they will vote on some
project, they can buy up (or if overpriced, short) its project token
ahead of releasing the decision.</li>
<li>If some group of people knows that they will later adjudicate on
some specific project, they can buy up the project token early and then
intentionally vote in its favor even if the project does not actually
deserve funding.</li>
<li>Funding deciders can accept bribes from projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are typically three ways of dealing with these types of
corruption and insider trading issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Retroactively punish</em> malicious deciders.</li>
<li>Proactively <em>filter for higher-quality</em> deciders.</li>
<li>Add <em>more</em> deciders.</li>
</ul>
<p>The corporate world typically focuses on the first two, using
financial surveillance and judicious penalties for the first and
in-person interviews and background checks for the second. The
decentralized world has less access to such tools: project tokens are
likely to be tradeable anonymously, DAOs have at best limited recourse
to external judicial systems, and the remote and online nature of the
projects and the desire for global inclusivity makes it harder to do
background checks and informal in-person "smell tests" for character.
Hence, the decentralized world needs to put more weight on the third
technique: distribute decision-making power among <em>more</em>
deciders, so that each individual decider has less power, and so
collusions are more likely to be whistleblown on and revealed.</p>
<h2
id="should-daos-learn-more-from-corporate-governance-or-political-science">Should
DAOs learn more from corporate governance or political science?</h2>
<p>Curtis Yarvin, an American philosopher whose primary "big idea" is
that corporations are much more effective and optimized than governments
and so we should improve governments by making them look more like
corporations (eg. by moving away from democracy and closer to monarchy),
recently wrote an article expressing <a
href="https://graymirror.substack.com/p/optimal-autonomous-organizations">his
thoughts on how DAO governance should be designed</a>. Not surprisingly,
his answer involves borrowing ideas from governance of traditional
corporations. From his introduction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead the basic design of the Anglo-American limited-liability
joint-stock company has remained roughly unchanged since the start of
the Industrial Revolution—which, a contrarian historian might argue,
might actually have been a Corporate Revolution. If the joint-stock
design is not perfectly optimal, we can expect it to be nearly
optimal.</p>
<p>While there is a categorical difference between these two types of
organizations—we could call them first-order (sovereign) and
second-order (contractual) organizations—it seems that society in the
current year has very effective second-order organizations, but not very
effective first-order organizations.</p>
<p>Therefore, we probably know more about second-order organizations.
So, when designing a DAO, we should start from corporate governance, not
political science.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yarvin's post is very correct in identifying the key difference
between "first-order" (sovereign) and "second-order" (contractual)
organizations - in fact, that exact distinction is precisely the topic
of the section in my own post above on credible fairness. However,
Yarvin's post makes a big, and surprising, mistake immediately after, by
immediately pivoting to saying that corporate governance is the better
starting point for how DAOs should operate. The mistake is surprising
because the logic of the situation seems to almost directly imply the
exact opposite conclusion. <strong>Because DAOs do not have a sovereign
above them, and are often explicitly in the business of providing
services (like currency and arbitration) that are typically reserved for
sovereigns, it is precisely the design of sovereigns (political
science), and not the design of corporate governance, that DAOs have
more to learn from.</strong></p>
<p>To Yarvin's credit, the second part of his post <em>does</em>
advocate an "hourglass" model that combines a decentralized alignment
and accountability layer and a centralized management and execution
layer, but this is already an admission that DAO design needs to learn
at least as much from first-order orgs as from second-order orgs.</p>
<p>Sovereigns are inefficient and corporations are efficient for the
same reason why number theory can prove very many things but abstract <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory">group theory</a> can
prove much fewer things: <strong>corporations fail less and accomplish
more because they can make more assumptions and have more powerful tools
to work with</strong>. Corporations can count on their local sovereign
to stand up to defend them if the need arises, as well as to provide an
external legal system they can lean on to stabilize their incentive
structure. In a sovereign, on the other hand, the biggest challenge is
often what to do when the incentive structure is under attack and/or at
risk of collapsing entirely, with no external leviathan standing ready
to support it.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest problem in the design of successful governance
systems for sovereigns is what <a
href="https://samoburja.com/the-succession-problem/">Samo Burja calls
"the succession problem"</a>: how to ensure continuity as the system
transitions from being run by one group of humans to another group as
the first group retires. Corporations, Burja writes, often just don't
solve the problem at all:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Silicon Valley enthuses over "disruption" because we have become so
used to the succession problem remaining unsolved within discrete
institutions such as companies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DAOs will need to solve the succession problem eventually (in fact,
given the sheer frequency of the "get rich and retire" pattern among
crypto early adopters, some DAOs have to deal with succession issues
<em>already</em>). Monarchies and corporate-like forms often have a hard
time solving the succession problem, because the institutional structure
gets deeply tied up with the habits of one specific person, and it
either proves difficult to hand off, or there is a very-high-stakes
struggle over whom to hand it off to. More decentralized political forms
like democracy have at least a theory of how smooth transitions can
happen. Hence, I would argue that for this reason too, DAOs have more to
learn from the more liberal and democratic schools of political science
than they do from the governance of corporations.</p>
<p>Of course, DAOs will in some cases have to accomplish specific
complicated tasks, and some use of corporate-like forms for
accomplishing those tasks may well be a good idea. Additionally, DAOs
need to handle unexpected uncertainty. A system that was intended to
function in a stable and unchanging way around one set of assumptions,
when faced with an extreme and unexpected change to those circumstances,
does need some kind of brave leader to coordinate a response. A
prototypical example of the latter is stablecoins handling a US dollar
collapse: what happens when a stablecoin DAO that evolved around the
assumption that it's just trying to track the US dollar suddenly faces a
world where the US dollar is no longer a viable thing to be tracking,
and a rapid switch to some kind of CPI is needed?</p>

<p>Here, corporate governance-inspired approaches may seem better,
because they offer a ready-made pattern for responding to such a
problem: the founder organizes a pivot. But as it turns out, the history
of political systems <em>also</em> offers a pattern well-suited to this
situation, and one that covers the question of how to go back to a
decentralized mode when the crisis is over: the Roman Republic custom of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_dictator">electing a
dictator</a> for a temporary term to respond to a crisis.</p>
<p><strong>Realistically, we probably only need a small number of DAOs
that look more like constructs from political science than something out
of corporate governance. But those are the really important
ones.</strong> A stablecoin does not need to be efficient; it must first
and foremost be stable and decentralized. A decentralized court is
similar. A system that directs funding for a particular cause - whether
Optimism retroactive funding, VitaDAO, UkraineDAO or something else - is
optimizing for a much more complicated purpose than profit maximization,
and so an alignment solution other than shareholder profit is needed to
make sure it keeps using the funds for the purpose that was
intended.</p>
<p>By far the greatest number of organizations, even in a crypto world,
<em>are</em> going to be "contractual" second-order organizations that
ultimately lean on these first-order giants for support, and for these
organizations, much simpler and leader-driven forms of governance
emphasizing agility are often going to make sense. But this should not
distract from the fact that the ecosystem would not survive without some
<em>non-corporate</em> decentralized forms keeping the whole thing
stable.</p>
