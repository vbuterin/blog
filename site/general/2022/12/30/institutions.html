<title> What even is an institution? </title>

<p><em>Special thanks to Dennis Pourteaux and Tina Zhen for discussion
that led to this post.</em></p>
<p>A recent alternative political compass proposed by Dennis Pourteaux
proposes that the most important political divide of our present time is
not liberty vs authoritarianism or left vs right, <a
href="https://pourteaux.substack.com/p/institutional-alignment">but
rather how we think about "institutions"</a>. Are the institutions that
society runs on today good or bad, and is the solution to work
incrementally to improve them, replace them with radically different
institutions, or do away with institutions altogether?</p>
<br>
<center>
<img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b7ab13d-2733-4de9-a9f0-50e2ecfdcfed_1024x924.png" style="width:450px" />
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>This, however, raises a really important question: <strong>what even
is an "institution" anyway?</strong></p>
<p>The word "institution" in political discourse brings to mind things
like national governments, the New York Times, universities and
<em>maybe</em> the local public library. But the word also gets used to
describe other kinds of things. The phrase "the institution of marriage"
is common in English-language discourse, and gets <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22the+institution+of+marriage%22">over
two million search results</a> on Google. If you ask Google point-blank,
"is family an institution", it answers yes.</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/institutions/google_answer.png" /></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>ChatGPT agrees:</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/institutions/chatgpt_answer.png" /></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>If we take ChatGPT's definition that "a social institution is a
pattern of behaviors and norms that exist within a society and are
thought to be essential to its functioning" seriously, then the New York
Times is not an institution - no one argues that it's literally
essential, and many people consider it to be actively harmful! And on
the other side, we can think of examples of things that <em>maybe are
institutions</em> that Pourteaux's "anti-institutionalists" would
approve of!</p>
<ul>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>The Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchains</li>
<li>The English language</li>
<li>Substack</li>
<li>Markets</li>
<li>Standards organizations dealing with international shipping</li>
</ul>
<p>This leads us to two related, but also somewhat separate,
questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>What is <em>really</em> the dividing line that makes some
things "institutions" in people's eyes and others not?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What kind of world do people who consider themselves
anti-institutionalists actually want to see? And what <em>should</em> an
anti-institutionalist in today's world be doing?</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="a-survey-experiment">A survey experiment</h2>
<p>Over the past week, I made a <a
href="https://cryptodon.lol/@vbuterin/109570542347764470">series</a> of
<a href="https://cryptodon.lol/@vbuterin/109576148299374533">polls</a>
on Mastodon where I provided many examples of different objects,
practices and social structures, and asked: is this an institution or
not? In some cases, I made different spins on the same concept to see
the effects of changing some specific variables. There were some
fascinating results.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
<p><br>
<img src="../../../../images/institutions/m1.png" style="height:320px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px" />
<img src="../../../../images/institutions/m2.png" style="height:320px; padding-bottom: 20px" />
<br><br></p>
<p>And:</p>
<p><br>
<img src="../../../../images/institutions/m3.png" style="height:320px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px" />
<img src="../../../../images/institutions/m4.png" style="height:320px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px" />
<img src="../../../../images/institutions/m5.png" style="height:320px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px" />
<br><br></p>
<p>And:</p>
<p><br>
<img src="../../../../images/institutions/m6.png" style="height:320px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px" />
<img src="../../../../images/institutions/m7.png" style="height:320px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px" />
<br><br></p>
<p>And, of course:</p>
<p><br>
<img src="../../../../images/institutions/m8.png" style="height:250px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px" />
<img src="../../../../images/institutions/m9.png" style="height:250px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px" />
<img src="../../../../images/institutions/mx.png" style="height:250px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px" />
<br><br></p>
<p>There's more fun ones: <a
href="https://cryptodon.lol/@vbuterin/109570543708271381">NYT</a> vs <a
href="https://cryptodon.lol/@vbuterin/109570629589076709">Russia
Today</a> vs <a
href="https://cryptodon.lol/@vbuterin/109570548373455136">Bitcoin
Magazine</a>, the <a
href="https://cryptodon.lol/@vbuterin/109576276734493858">solar
system</a> vs <a
href="https://cryptodon.lol/@vbuterin/109576290616996040">what if we
started re-engineering it</a>, <a
href="https://cryptodon.lol/@vbuterin/109576149554493641">prediction
markets</a>, various <a
href="https://cryptodon.lol/@vbuterin/109570587677425299">social</a> <a
href="https://cryptodon.lol/@vbuterin/109570583709002906">customs</a>,
and a lot more.</p>
<p>Here, we can already start to see some common factors. Marriage is
more institution-y than romantic relationships, likely because of its
official stamp of recognition, and more mainstream relationship styles
are more institution-y than less mainstream styles (a pattern that
repeats itself when comparing NYT vs Russia Today vs Bitcoin Magazine).
Systems with clearly visible human beings making decisions are more
institution-y than more impersonal algorithmic structures, even if their
outputs are ultimately entirely a function of human-provided inputs.</p>
<p>To try to elucidate things further, I decided to do a more systematic
analysis.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-some-common-factors">What are some common factors?</h2>
<p>Robin Hanson <a
href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/2022/12/elites-must-rule.html">recently
made a post</a> in which he argued that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At least on prestigious topics, most people want relevant
institutions to take the following ideal form:</p>
<p><strong>Masses recognize elites, who oversee experts, who pick
details.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seemed to me to be an important and valuable insight, though in
a somewhat different direction: yes, that is the style of institution
that people find familiar and are not <em>weirded out by</em> (as they
might when they see many of the "alternative institutions" that Hanson
<a href="https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/altinst.html">likes to
propose</a>), but it's also exactly the style of institutions that
anti-institutionalists tend to most strongly rail against! Mark
Zuckerberg's very institution-y <a
href="https://transparency.fb.com/oversight/creation-of-oversight-board/">oversight
board</a> certainly followed the "masses recognize elites who oversee
experts" template fairly well, but it did not really make a lot of
people happy.</p>
<p>I decided to give this theory of institution-ness, along with some
other theories, a test. I identified seven properties that seemed to me
possible important characteristics of institutions, with the goal of
identifying which ones are most strongly correlated to people thinking
of something as being an institution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it have a "<strong>masses recognize elites</strong>"
pattern?</li>
<li>Does it have a "<strong>elites oversee experts</strong>"
pattern?</li>
<li>Is it <strong>mainstream</strong>?</li>
<li>Is it <a
href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274"><strong>logically
centralized</strong></a>?</li>
<li>Does it involve <strong>interaction between people</strong>? (eg.
intermittent fasting doesn't, as everyone just chooses whether or not to
do it separately, but a government does)</li>
<li>Does it have a specific <strong><em>structure</em></strong> that has
a lot of <strong>intentional design</strong> behind it? (eg.
corporations do, friendship doesn't)</li>
<li>Does it have <strong><em>roles</em></strong> that take on a life
<strong>independent of the individuals</strong> that fill them? (eg.
democratically elected governments do, after all they even call the
leader "Mr. President", but a podcast which is named after its sole host
does not at all)</li>
</ul>
<p>I went through the list and personally graded the 35
maybe-institutions from my polls on these categories. For example, Tesla
got:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>25% on "masses recognize elites"</strong> (because it's run
by Elon Musk, who does in practice have a lot of recognition and support
as a celebrity, but this isn't a deeply intrinsic feature of Tesla, Elon
won't get kicked out of Tesla if he loses legitimacy, etc)</li>
<li><strong>100% on "elites oversee experts"</strong> (all large
corporations follow this pattern)</li>
<li><strong>75% on "is mainstream"</strong> (almost everyone knows about
it, lots of people have them, but it's not <em>quite</em> a New York
Times-level household name)</li>
<li><strong>100% on "logical centralization"</strong> (most things get
100% on this score; as a counterexample, "dating sites" get 50% because
there are many dating sites and "intermittent fasting" gets 0%)</li>
<li><strong>100% on "involves interaction between people"</strong>
(Tesla produces products that it sells to people, and it hires
employees, has investors, etc)</li>
<li><strong>75% on "intentional structure"</strong> (Tesla definitely
has a deep structure with shareholders, directors, management, etc, but
that structure isn't really part of its <em>identity</em> in the way
that, say, proof of stake consensus is for Ethereum or voting and
congress are for a government)</li>
<li><strong>50% for "roles independent of individuals"</strong> (while
roles in companies are generally interchangeable, Tesla does get large
gains from being part of the Elon-verse specifically)</li>
</ul>
<p>The full data is <a
href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/files/misc_files/institution_analysis.ods">here</a>.
I know that many people will have many disagreements over various
individual rankings I make, and readers could probably convince me that
a few of my scores are wrong; I am mainly hoping that I've included a
sufficient number of diverse maybe-instiutions in the list that
individual disagreement or errors get roughly averaged out.</p>
<p>Here's the table of correlations:</p>
<br>
<table>
<tr>

0.491442156943094

<p><br></p>
<p>But as it turns out, the correlations are misleading. "Interaction
between people" turns out to be an almost unquestionably
<em>necessary</em> property for something to have to be an institution.
The correlation of 0.57 <em>kind of</em> shows it, but it understates
the strength of the relationship:</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/institutions/correl1.png" /></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Literally <em>every</em> thing that I labeled as clearly involving
interaction had a higher percentage of people considering it an
institution than <em>every</em> thing I labeled as not involving
interaction. The single dot in the center is my hypothetical example of
an island where people with odd-numbered birthdays are not allowed to
eat meat before 12:00; I didn't want to give it 100% because the
not-meat-eating is a private activity, but the question still strongly
implies some social or other pressure to follow the rule so it's also
not really 0%. This is a place where <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient">Spearman's
coefficient</a> outperforms Pearson's, but rather than spurting out
exotic numbers I'd rather just show the charts. Here are the other
six:</p>
<p><br>

<img src="../../../../images/institutions/correl3.png" style="width: 340px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px" />
<img src="../../../../images/institutions/correl4.png" style="width: 340px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px" />
<img src="../../../../images/institutions/correl5.png" style="width: 340px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px" />
<img src="../../../../images/institutions/correl6.png" style="width: 340px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px" />
<img src="../../../../images/institutions/correl7.png" style="width: 340px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px" />
<br><br></p>
<p>The most surprising finding for me is that <strong>"roles independent
of individuals" is by far the weakest correlation</strong>. Twitter run
by a democracy is the most institution-y of all, but Twitter run by a
pay-to-govern scheme is as institution-y as Twitter that's just run by
Elon directly. Roles being independent of individuals adds a guarantee
of stability, but roles being independent of individuals <em>in the
wrong way</em> feels too unfamiliar, or casual, or otherwise not
institution-like. Dating sites are more independent of individuals than
professional matchmaking agencies, and yet it's the matchmaking agencies
that are seen as more institution-like. Attempts at highly role-driven
and mechanistic credibly-neutral media, (eg. <a
href="https://cryptodon.lol/@vbuterin/109576172987142068">this
contraption</a>, which I actually think would be really cool) just feel
<em>alien</em> - perhaps in a bad way, but also perhaps in a good way,
if you find the institutions of today frustrating and you're open-minded
about possible alternatives.</p>
<p>Correlations with "masses recognize elites" and "elites oversee
experts" were high; higher for the second than the first, though perhaps
Hanson and I had different meanings in mind for "recognize". The
"intentional structure" chart has an empty bottom-right corner but a
full top-left corner, suggesting that <strong>intentional structure is
necessary but not sufficient for something to be an
institution</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>That said, my main conclusion is probably that the term
"institution" is a big mess</strong>. Rather than the term "institution"
referring to a single coherent cluster of concepts (as eg. <a
href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/">"high
modernism" does</a>), the term seems to have a number of
<em>different</em> definitions at play:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A structure that fits the familiar pattern of "masses recognize
elites who oversee experts"</li>
<li>Any intentionally designed large-scale structure that mediates human
interaction (including things like financial markets, social media
platforms and dating sites)</li>
<li>Widely spread and standardized social customs in general</li>
</ol>
<p>I suspect that anti-institutionalists focus their suspicion on (1),
and especially instances of (1) that have been captured by the wrong
tribe. <strong>Whether a structure is personalistic or role-driven does
not seem to be very important to anti-institutionalists</strong>: both
personalities ("<a
href="https://brief.bismarckanalysis.com/p/the-strategy-of-klaus-schwabs-world">Klaus
Schwab</a>") and bureaucracies ("woke academics") are equally capable of
coming from the wrong tribe. Anti-institutionalists generally do not
oppose (3), and indeed in many cases want to see (3) replace (1) as much
as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Support for (2) probably maps closely to Pourteaux's
"techno-optimist" vs "techno-minimalist" distinction</strong>.
Techno-minimalists don't see things like Twitter, Substack, Bitcoin,
Ethereum, etc as part of the solution, though there are "Bitcoin
minimalists" who see the Bitcoin blockchain as a narrow exception and
otherwise want to see a world where things like family decide more of
the outcomes. "Techno-optimist anti-institutionalists" are specifically
engaged in a political project of either trying to replace (1) with the
right kind of (2), or trying to reform (1) by introducing more elements
of the right kind of (2).</p>
<h2
id="which-way-forward-for-anti-institutionalists-or-institutional-reformers">Which
way forward for anti-institutionalists or institutional reformers?</h2>
<p>It would be wrong to ascribe too much intentional strategy to
anti-institutionalists: anti-institutionalism is a movement that is much
more united in what is against than in support of any specific
particular alternative. But what <em>is</em> possible is to recognize
this pattern, and ask the question of which paths forward make sense for
anti-institutionalists.</p>
<p>From a language point of view, <strong>even using the word
"institution" at all seems more likely to confuse than enlighten at this
point</strong>. There is a crucial difference between (i) a desire to
replace structures that contain enshrined elite roles with structures
that don't, (ii) a preference for small-scale and informal structures
over large-scale and formal ones, (iii) a desire to simply swap the
current elites out for new elites, and (iv) a kind of social libertinist
position that individuals should be driven by their own whims and not by
incentives created by other people. The word "institution" obscures that
divide, and probably focuses too much attention on what is being torn
down rather than what is to be built up in its place.</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/institutions/whichway.png" /></p>
<p><small><i>Different anti-institutionalists have different goals in
mind. Sure, the person on Twitter delivering that powerful incisive
criticism of the New York Times agrees with you on how society
<strong>should not</strong> be run, but are you sure they'll be your
ally when it comes time to decide how society <strong>should</strong> be
run?</i></small></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>The challenge with avoiding structures entirely is clear: prisoner's
dilemmas exist and we need incentives. The challenge with small-scale
and informal structures is often clear: economies of scale and gains
from standardization - though sometimes there are other benefits from
informal approaches that are worth losing those gains. The challenge
with simply swapping the elites is clear: it has no path to socially
scale into a cross-tribal consensus. If the goal is not to enshrine a
new set of elites forever, but for elites to permanently be high-churn
(cf. Balaji's <a
href="https://thenetworkstate.com/founding-vs-inheriting">founder vs
inheritor</a> dichotomy), that is more credibly neutral, but then it
starts getting closer to the territory of avoiding <em>enshrined
elites</em> in general.</p>
<p>Creating formal structures without enshrined elites is fascinating,
not least because it's under-explored: there's a strong case that
institutions with enshrined elite roles might be an unfortunate
historical necessity from when communication was more constrained, but
modern information technology (including the internet and also newer
spookier stuff like zero-knowledge cryptography, blockchains and DAOs)
could rapidly expand our available options. That said, as Hanson points
out, this path has its own fair share of challenges too.</p>
