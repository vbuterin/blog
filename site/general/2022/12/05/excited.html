<title> What in the Ethereum application ecosystem excites me </title>

<p><em>Special thanks to Matt Huang, Santi Siri and Tina Zhen for
feedback and review</em></p>
<p>Ten, five, or even two years ago, my opinions on what Ethereum and
blockchains can do for the world were very abstract. "This is a
general-purpose technology, like C++", I would say; of course, it has
specific properties like decentralization, openness and censorship
resistance, but beyond that it's just too early to say which specific
applications are going to make the most sense.</p>
<p>Today's world is no longer that world. Today, enough time has passed
that there are few ideas that are completely unexplored: if something
succeeds, it will <em>probably</em> be some version of something that
has already been discussed in blogs and forums and conferences on
multiple occasions. We've also come closer to identifying fundamental
limits of the space. Many DAOs have had a fair chance with an
enthusiastic audience willing to participate in them despite the
inconveniences and fees, and many have underperformed. Industrial
supply-chain applications <a
href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/11/30/ibm_and_maersk_tradelens_shutdown/">have
not gone anywhere</a>. Decentralized Amazon on the blockchain has not
happened. But it's also a world where we have seen genuine and growing
adoption of a few key applications that are meeting people's real needs
- and those are the applications that we need to focus on.</p>
<p>Hence my change in perspective: my excitement about Ethereum is now
no longer based in the potential for undiscovered unknowns, but rather
in a few specific categories of applications that are proving themselves
already, and are only getting stronger. What are these applications, and
which applications am I no longer optimistic about? That is what this
post will be about.</p>
<h2 id="money-the-first-and-still-most-important-app">1. Money: the
first and still most important app</h2>
<p>When I first visited Argentina in December last year, one of the
experiences I remember well was walking around on Christmas Day, when
almost everything is closed, looking for a coffee shop. After passing by
about five closed ones, we finally found one that was open. When we
walked in, the owner recognized me, and immediately showed me that he
has ETH and other crypto-assets on his Binance account. We ordered tea
and snacks, and we asked if we could pay in ETH. The coffee shop owner
obliged, and showed me the QR code for his Binance deposit address, to
which I sent about $20 of ETH from my Status wallet on my phone.</p>
<p>This was far from the most meaningful use of cryptocurrency that is
taking place in the country. Others are using it to save money, transfer
money internationally, make payments for large and important
transactions, and much more. But even still, the fact that I randomly
found a coffee shop and it happened to accept cryptocurrency showed the
sheer reach of adoption. Unlike wealthy countries like the United
States, where financial transactions are easy to make and 8% inflation
is considered extreme, in <a
href="https://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=USD&amp;to=ARS&amp;view=5Y">Argentina</a>
and <a href="http://www.farsinet.com/toman/exchange.html">many</a> other
<a
href="https://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=USD&amp;to=TRY&amp;view=5Y">countries</a>
around the world, links to global financial systems are more limited and
extreme inflation is a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Venezuela">reality</a>
every day. Cryptocurrency often steps in as a lifeline.</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/excited/exchange_ad.png" /></p>
<p><small><i>In addition to Binance, there is also an increasing number
of local exchanges, and you can see advertisements for them everywhere
including at airports.</i></small></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>The one issue with my coffee transaction is that it did not really
make pragmatic sense. The fee was high, about a third of the value of
the transaction. The transaction took several minutes to confirm: I
believe that at the time, Status did not yet support sending proper
EIP-1559 transactions that more reliably confirm quickly. If, like many
other Argentinian crypto users, I had simply had a Binance wallet, the
transfer would have been free and instant.</p>
<p>A year later, however, the calculus is different. As a side effect of
the Merge, transactions get included significantly more quickly and the
chain has become more stable, making it safer to accept transactions
after fewer confirmations. Scaling technology such as <a
href="../../../2021/01/05/rollup.html">optimistic and ZK rollups</a> is
proceeding quickly. <a href="../../../2021/01/11/recovery.html">Social
recovery and multisig</a> wallets are becoming more practical with <a
href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337">account abstraction</a>.
These trends will take years to play out as the technology develops, but
progress is already being made. At the same time, <strong>there is an
important "push factor" driving interest in transacting on-chain: the
FTX collapse</strong>, which has reminded everyone, Latin Americans
included, that even the most trustworthy-seeming centralized services
may not be trustworthy after all.</p>
<h3 id="cryptocurrency-in-wealthy-countries">Cryptocurrency in wealthy
countries</h3>
<p>In wealthy countries, the more extreme use cases around surviving
high inflation and doing basic financial activities at all usually do
not apply. But cryptocurrency still has significant value. As someone
who has used it to make donations (to quite normal organizations in many
countries), I can personally confirm that it is <em>far</em> more
convenient than traditional banking. It's also valuable for industries
and activities at risk of being deplatformed by payment processors - a
category which includes <a
href="https://signaturepayments.com/why-high-risk-industries-are-avoided-by-payment-processors/">many
industries</a> that are perfectly legal under most countries' laws.</p>
<p>There is also the important broader philosophical case for
cryptocurrency as private money: the transition to a "cashless society"
is being taken advantage of by many governments as an opportunity to
introduce levels of financial surveillance that would be unimaginable
100 years ago. <strong>Cryptocurrency is the <em>only</em> thing
currently being developed that can realistically combine the benefits of
digitalization with cash-like respect for personal privacy</strong>.</p>
<p>But in either case, cryptocurrency is far from perfect. Even with all
the technical, user experience and account safety problems solved, it
remains a fact that cryptocurrency is volatile, and the volatility can
make it difficult to use for savings and business. For that reason, we
have...</p>
<h3 id="stablecoins">Stablecoins</h3>
<p>The value of stablecoins has been understood in the Ethereum
community for a long time. Quoting <a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/11/search-stable-cryptocurrency">a
blog post from 2014</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the past eleven months, Bitcoin holders have lost about 67% of
their wealth and quite often the price moves up or down by as much as
25% in a single week. Seeing this concern, there is a growing interest
in a simple question: can we get the best of both worlds? Can we have
the full decentralization that a cryptographic payment network offers,
but at the same time have a higher level of price stability, without
such extreme upward and downward swings?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And indeed, stablecoins are very popular among precisely those users
who are making pragmatic use of cryptocurrency today. That said, there
is a reality that is not congenial to cypherpunk values today: the
stablecoins that are most successful today are the centralized ones,
mostly USDC, USDT and BUSD.</p>

Three of the top six are centralized stablecoins.</p>
<p></i></small></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Stablecoins issued on-chain have many convenient properties: they are
open for use by anyone, they are resistant to the most large-scale and
opaque forms of censorship (the issuer <em>can</em> blacklist and freeze
addresses, but such blacklisting is transparent, and there are literal
transaction fee costs associated with freezing each address), and they
interact well with on-chain infrastructure (accounts, DEXes, etc). But
it's not clear how long this state of affairs will last, and so there is
a need to keep working on other alternatives.</p>
<p>I see the stablecoin design space as basically being split into three
different categories: <strong>centralized stablecoins</strong>,
<strong>DAO-governed real-world-asset backed stablecoins</strong> and
<strong>governance-minimized crypto-backed stablecoins</strong>.</p>

</table>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>From the user's perspective, the three types are arranged on
a tradeoff spectrum between efficiency and resilience</strong>. USDC
works today, and will almost certainly work tomorrow. But in the longer
term, its ongoing stability depends on the macroeconomic and political
stability of the United States, a continued US regulatory environment
that supports making USDC available to everyone, and the trustworthiness
of the issuing organization.</p>
<p>RAI, on the other hand, can survive all of these risks, but it has a
negative interest rate: at the time of this writing, <a
href="https://stats.reflexer.finance/">-6.7%</a>. To make the system
stable (so, <a href="../../../2022/05/25/stable.html">not be vulnerable
to collapse like LUNA</a>), every holder of RAI must be matched by a
holder of negative RAI (aka. a "borrower" or "CDP holder") who puts in
ETH as collateral. This rate could be improved with more people engaging
in arbitrage, holding negative RAI and balancing it out with positive
USDC or even interest-bearing bank account deposits, but interest rates
on RAI will always be lower than in a functioning banking system, and
the possibility of negative rates, and the user experience headaches
that they imply, will always be there.</p>
<p>The RAI model is ultimately ideal for the more pessimistic <a
href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/09/20/what-are-solarpunk-and-lunarpunk-anyway/">lunarpunk</a>
world: it avoids all connection to non-crypto financial systems, making
it much more difficult to attack. Negative interest rates prevent it
from being a convenient proxy for the dollar, but one way to adapt would
be to embrace the disconnection: <strong>a governance-minimized
stablecoin could track some non-currency asset like a global average CPI
index, and advertise itself as representing abstract "best-effort price
stability"</strong>. This would also have lower inherent regulatory
risk, as such an asset would not be attempting to provide a "digital
dollar" (or euro, or...).</p>
<p>DAO-governed RWA-backed stablecoins, if they can be made to work
well, could be a happy medium. Such stablecoins could combine enough
robustness, censorship resistance, scale and economic practicality to
satisfy the needs of a large number of real-world crypto users. But
making this work requires both real-world legal work to develop robust
issuers, <em>and</em> a healthy dose of <a
href="../../../2022/09/20/daos.html">resilience-oriented DAO governance
engineering</a>.</p>
<p>In either case, <em>any</em> kind of stablecoin working well would be
a boon for many kinds of currency and savings applications that are
already concretely useful for millions of people today.</p>
<h2 id="defi-keep-it-simple">2. Defi: keep it simple</h2>
<p>Decentralized finance is, in my view, a category that started off
honorable but limited, turned into somewhat of an overcapitalized
monster that relied on unsustainable forms of yield farming, and is now
in the early stages of setting down into a stable medium, improving
security and refocusing on a few applications that are particularly
valuable. Decentralized stablecoins are, and probably forever will be,
the most important defi product, but there are a few others that have an
important niche:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prediction markets</strong>: these have been a niche but
stable pillar of decentralized finance since the launch of Augur in
2015. Since then, they have quietly been growing in adoption. Prediction
markets <a href="../../../2021/02/18/election.html">showed their value
and their limitations</a> in the 2020 US election, and this year in
2022, both crypto prediction markets like <a
href="https://polymarket.com/">Polymarket</a> and play-money markets
like <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/">Metaculus</a> are
becoming more and more widely used. Prediction markets are valuable as
an epistemic tool, and there is a genuine benefit from using
cryptocurrency in making these markets more trustworthy and more
globally accessible. I expect prediction markets to not make extreme
multibillion-dollar splashes, but continue to steadily grow and become
more useful over time.</li>
<li><strong>Other synthetic assets</strong>: the formula behind
stablecoins can in principle be replicated to other real-world assets.
Interesting natural candidates include major stock indices and real
estate. The latter will take longer to get right due to the inherent
heterogeneity and complexity of the space, but it could be valuable for
precisely the same reasons. The main question is whether or not someone
can create the right balance of decentralization and efficiency that
gives users access to these assets at reasonable rates of return.</li>
<li><strong>Glue layers for efficiently trading between other
assets</strong>: if there are assets on-chain that people want to use,
including ETH, centralized or decentralized stablecoins, more advanced
synthetic assets, or whatever else, there will be value in a layer that
makes it easy for users to trade between them. Some users may want to
hold USDC and pay transaction fees in USDC. Others may hold some assets,
but want to be able to instantly convert to pay someone who wants to be
paid in another asset. There is also space for using one asset as
collateral to take out loans of another asset, though such projects are
most likely to succeed and avoid leading to tears if they keep leverage
<em>very</em> limited (eg. not more than 2x).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-identity-ecosystem-ens-siwe-poh-poaps-sbts">3. The identity
ecosystem: ENS, SIWE, PoH, POAPs, SBTs</h2>
<p>"Identity" is a complicated concept that can mean many things. Some
examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic authentication</strong>: simply proving that action A
(eg. sending a transaction or logging into a website) was authorized by
some agent that has some identifier, such as an ETH address or a public
key, without attempting to say anything else about who or what the agent
is.</li>
<li><strong>Attestations</strong>: proving claims about an agent made by
other agents ("Bob attests that he knows Alice", "the government of
Canada attests that Charlie is a citizen")</li>
<li><strong>Names</strong>: establishing consensus that a particular
human-readable name can be used to refer to a particular agent.</li>
<li><strong><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_personhood">Proof of
personhood</a></strong>: proving that an agent is human, and
guaranteeing that each human can only obtain one identity through the
proof of personhood system (this is often done with attestations, so
it's not an entirely separate category, but it's a hugely important
special case)</li>
</ul>
<p>For a long time, I have been bullish on <em>blockchain identity</em>
but bearish on <em>blockchain identity platforms</em>. The use cases
mentioned above are really important to many blockchain use cases, and
blockchains are valuable for identity applications because of their
institution-independent nature and the interoperability benefits that
they provide. But what will not work is an attempt to create a
centralized platform to achieve all of these tasks from scratch. What
more likely will work is an organic approach, with many projects working
on specific tasks that are individually valuable, and adding more and
more interoperability over time.</p>
<p>And this is exactly what has happened since then. The <a
href="https://login.xyz/">Sign In With Ethereum (SIWE)</a> standard
allows users to log into (traditional) websites in much the same way
that you can use Google or Facebook accounts to log into websites today.
This is actually useful: it allows you to interact with a site without
giving Google or Facebook access to your private information or the
ability to take over or lock you out of your account. Techniques like <a
href="../../../2021/01/11/recovery.html">social recovery</a> could give
users account recovery options in case they forget their password that
are <em>much better</em> than what centralized corporations offer today.
SIWE is supported by many applications today, including <a
href="https://chat.blockscan.com/">Blockscan chat</a>, the
end-to-end-encrypted email and notes service <a
href="https://app.skiff.com/">Skiff</a>, and various blockchain-based
alternative social media projects.</p>
<p>ENS lets users have usernames: I have <code>vitalik.eth</code>. Proof
of Humanity and other proof-of-personhood systems let users prove that
they are unique humans, which is useful in many applications including
airdrops and governance. <a href="https://poap.xyz/">POAP</a> (the
"proof of attendance protocol", pronounced <a
href="https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1534555001326080001">either
"pope" or "poe-app"</a> depending on whether you're a brave contrarian
or a sheep) is a general-purpose protocol for issuing tokens that
represent attestations: have you completed an educational course? Have
you attended an event? Have you met a particular person? POAPs could be
used both as an ingredient in a proof-of-personhood protocol and as a
way to try to determine whether or not someone is a member of a
particular community (valuable for governance or airdrops).</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/excited/nfc_card.png" /></p>
<p><small><i></p>
<p>An NFC card that contains my ENS name, and allows you to receive a
POAP verifying that you've met me. I'm not sure I <strong>want</strong>
to create any further incentive for people to bug me really hard to get
my POAP, but this seems fun and useful for other people.</p>
<p></i></small></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Each of these applications are useful individually. But what makes
them truly powerful is how well they compose with each other. When I log
on to <a href="https://chat.blockscan.com/">Blockscan chat</a>, I sign
in with Ethereum. This means that I am immediately visible as
<code>vitalik.eth</code> (my ENS name) to anyone I chat with. In the
future, to fight spam, Blockscan chat could "verify" accounts by looking
at on-chain activity or POAPs. The lowest tier would simply be to verify
that the account has sent or been the recipient in at least one on-chain
transaction (as that requires paying fees). A higher level of
verification could involve checking for balances of specific tokens,
ownership of specific POAPs, a proof-of-personhood profile, or a
meta-aggregator like <a href="https://passport.gitcoin.co/">Gitcoin
Passport</a>.</p>
<p>The network effects of these different services combine to create an
ecosystem that provides some very powerful options for users and
applications. An Ethereum-based Twitter alternative (eg. <a
href="https://www.farcaster.xyz/">Farcaster</a>) could use POAPs and
other proofs of on-chain activity to create a "verification" feature
that does not require conventional KYC, allowing anons to participate.
Such platforms could create rooms that are gated to members of a
particular community - or hybrid approaches where only community members
can speak but anyone can listen. The equivalent of Twitter polls could
be limited to particular communities.</p>
<p>Equally importantly, there are much more pedestrian applications that
are relevant to simply helping people make a living: verification
through attestations can make it easier for people to prove that they
are trustworthy to get rent, employment or loans.</p>
<p><strong>The big future challenge for this ecosystem is
privacy</strong>. The status quo involves putting large amounts of
information on-chain, which is something that is "fine until it's not",
and eventually will become unpalatable if not outright risky to more and
more people. There are ways to solve this problem by combining on-chain
and off-chain information and making <a
href="../../../2022/06/15/using_snarks.html">heavy use of ZK-SNARKs</a>,
but this is something that will actually need to be worked on; projects
like <a href="https://www.sismo.io/">Sismo</a> and <a
href="https://www.heyanon.xyz/">HeyAnon</a> are an early start. Scaling
is also a challenge, but scaling can be solved generically with rollups
and perhaps validiums. Privacy cannot, and must be worked on
intentionally for each application.</p>
<h2 id="daos">4. DAOs</h2>
<p>"DAO" is a powerful term that captures many of the hopes and dreams
that people have put into the crypto space to build more democratic,
resilient and efficient forms of governance. It's also an incredibly
broad term whose <a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide">meaning</a>
has evolved a lot over the years. Most generally, a DAO is a smart
contract that is meant to represent a structure of ownership or control
over some asset or process. But this structure could be anything, from
the lowly multisig to highly sophisticated multi-chamber governance
mechanisms like those proposed for the <a
href="https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/">Optimism
Collective</a>. Many of these structures work, and many others cannot,
or at least are very mismatched to the goals that they are trying to
achieve.</p>
<p>There are two questions to answer:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What kinds of governance structures make sense, and for what use
cases?</li>
<li>Does it make sense to implement those structures as a DAO, or
through regular incorporation and legal contracts?</li>
</ol>
<p>A particular subtlety is that the word "decentralized" is sometimes
used to refer to both: a <em>governance structure</em> is decentralized
if its decisions depend on decisions taken from a large group of
participants, and an <em>implementation</em> of a governance structure
is decentralized if it is built on a decentralized structure like a
blockchain and is not dependent on any single nation-state legal
system.</p>
<h3 id="decentralization-for-robustness">Decentralization for
robustness</h3>
<p>One way to think about the distinction is: <strong>decentralized
governance structure protects against attackers on the inside, and a
decentralized implementation protects against powerful attackers on the
outside ("censorship resistance")</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://thepiratebay.org/index.html">The Pirate Bay</a> and
<a href="https://www.sci-hub.se/">Sci-Hub</a> are important case studies
of something that is censorship-resistant, but does not need
decentralization. Sci-Hub is largely run by one person, and if some part
of Sci-Hub infrastructure gets taken down, she can simply move it
somewhere else. The Sci-Hub URL has changed many times over the years.
The Pirate Bay is a hybrid: it relies on BitTorrent, which <em>is</em>
decentralized, but the Pirate Bay itself is a centralized convenience
layer on top.</p>
<p>The difference between these two examples and blockchain projects is
that they do not attempt to protect their users against the platform
itself. If Sci-Hub or The Pirate Bay wanted to harm their users, the
worst they could do is either serve bad results or shut down - either of
which would only cause minor inconvenience until their users switch to
other alternatives that would inevitably pop up in their absence. They
could also publish user IP addresses, but even if they did that the
total harm to users would still be much lower than, say, stealing all
the users' funds.</p>
<p>Stablecoins are <em>not</em> like this. Stablecoins are trying to
create stable <a
href="https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/">credibly neutral</a>
global commercial infrastructure, and this demands both lack of
dependence on a single centralized actor on the outside <em>and</em>
protection against attackers from the inside. If a stablecoin's
governance is poorly designed, an attack on the governance could steal
billions of dollars from users.</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, MakerDAO has <a
href="https://daistats.com/#/">$7.8 billion</a> in collateral, over 17x
the market cap of the profit-taking token, <a
href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/maker">MKR</a>. Hence, if
governance was up to MKR holders with no safeguards, someone could buy
up half the MKR, use that to manipulate the price oracles, and steal a
large portion of the collateral for themselves. In fact, this <a
href="https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/crypto/heres-how-an-attacker-drained-182-million-from-beanstalk-stablecoin-protocol-7875095/">actually
happened with a smaller stablecoin</a>! It hasn't happened to MKR yet
largely because the MKR holdings are still fairly concentrated, with the
majority of the MKR held by a fairly small group that would not be
willing to sell because they believe in the project. This is a fine
model to get a stablecoin started, but not a good one for the long term.
Hence, making decentralized stablecoins work long term requires
innovating in decentralized governance that does not have these kinds of
flaws.</p>
<p>Two possible directions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some kind of <a
href="../../../2021/08/16/voting3.html">non-financialized
governance</a>, or perhaps a bicameral hybrid where decisions need to be
passed not just by token holders but also by some other class of user
(eg. the Optimism <a
href="https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/">Citizens'
House</a> or stETH holders as in the <a
href="https://hackmd.io/@lido/BJKmFkM-i">Lido two-chamber
proposal</a>)</li>
<li><a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/a-not-quite-cryptoeconomic-decentralized-oracle/6453">Intentional
friction</a>, making it so that certain kinds of decisions can only take
effect after a delay long enough that users can see that something is
going wrong and escape the system.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many subtleties in making governance that effectively
optimizes for robustness. If the system's robustness depends on pathways
that are only activated in extreme edge cases, the system may even want
to intentionally test those pathways once in a while to make sure that
they work - much like the once-every-20-years rebuilding of <a
href="https://theprepared.org/features-feed/ise-jingu-and-the-pyramid-of-enabling-technologies">Ise
Jingu</a>. This aspect of decentralization for robustness continues to
require more careful thought and development.</p>
<h3 id="decentralization-for-efficiency">Decentralization for
efficiency</h3>
<p>Decentralization for efficiency is a different school of thought:
<strong>decentralized governance structure is valuable because it can
incorporate opinions from more diverse voices at different scales, and
decentralized implementation is valuable because it can sometimes be
more efficient and lower cost than traditional legal-system-based
approaches</strong>.</p>
<p>This implies a different <em>style</em> of decentralization.
Governance decentralized for robustness emphasizes having a large number
of decision-makers to ensure <em>alignment</em> with a pre-set goal, and
<em>intentionally makes pivoting more difficult</em>. Governance
decentralized for efficiency preserves the ability to act rapidly and
pivot if needed, but tries to move decisions away from the top to avoid
the organization becoming a sclerotic bureaucracy.</p>

<p><small><i>Pod-based governance in Ukraine DAO. This style of
governance improves efficiency by maximizing autonomy.</i></small></p>
</center>
<p>Decentralized implementations designed for robustness and
decentralized implementations designed for efficiency are in one way
similar: they both just involve putting assets into smart contracts. But
decentralized implementations designed for efficiency are going to be
much simpler: just a basic multisig will generally suffice.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that "decentralizing for efficiency" is a weak
argument for large-scale projects in the same wealthy country. But it's
a stronger argument for very-small-scale projects, highly
internationalized projects, and projects located in countries with
inefficient institutions and weak rule of law. Many applications of
"decentralizing for efficiency" probably <em>could</em> also be done on
a central-bank-run chain run by a stable large country; I suspect that
both decentralized approaches and centralized approaches are good
enough, and it's the path-dependent question of which one becomes viable
first that will determine which approach dominates.</p>
<h3 id="decentralization-for-interoperability">Decentralization for
interoperability</h3>
<p>This is a fairly boring class of reasons to decentralize, but it's
still important: <strong>it's easier and more secure for on-chain things
to interact with other on-chain things, than with off-chain systems that
would inevitably require an (attackable) bridge layer</strong>.</p>
<p>If a large organization running on direct democracy holds 10,000 ETH
in its reserves, that would be a decentralized governance decision, but
it would not be a decentralized implementation: in practice, that
country would have a few people managing the keys and that storage
system could get attacked.</p>
<p>There is also a governance angle to this: if a system provides
services to <em>other</em> DAOs that are not capable of rapid change, it
is better for that system to itself be incapable of rapid change, to
avoid "rigidity mismatch" where a system's dependencies break and that
system's rigidity renders it unable to adapt to the break.</p>
<p>These three "theories of decentralization" can be put into a chart as

<h3
id="decentralization-and-fancy-new-governance-mechanisms">Decentralization
and fancy new governance mechanisms</h3>
<p>Over the last few decades, we've seen the development of a number of
fancy new governance mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../2019/12/07/quadratic.html">Quadratic
voting</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../2021/02/18/election.html">Futarchy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy">Liquid
democracy</a></li>
<li>Decentralized <em>conversation</em> tools like <a
href="https://pol.is/">Pol.is</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These ideas are an important part of the DAO story, and they can be
valuable for both robustness <em>and</em> efficiency. The case for
quadratic voting relies on a mathematical argument that it makes the
exactly correct tradeoff between giving space for stronger preferences
to outcompete weaker but more popular preferences and not weighting
stronger preferences (or wealthy actors) <em>too much</em>. But people
who have used it have found that it can improve robustness too. Newer
ideas, like <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/pairwise-coordination-subsidies-a-new-quadratic-funding-design/5553">pairwise
matching</a>, <em>intentionally</em> sacrifice mathematically provable
optimality for robustness in situations where the mathematical model's
assumptions break.</p>
<p>These ideas, in addition to more "traditional" centuries-old ideas
around multicameral architectures and intentional indirection and
delays, are going to be an important part of the story in making DAOs
more effective, though they will also find value in improving the
efficiency of traditional organizations.</p>
<h3 id="case-study-gitcoin-grants">Case study: Gitcoin Grants</h3>
<p>We can analyze the different styles of decentralization through an
interesting edge-case: Gitcoin Grants. Should Gitcoin Grants be an
on-chain DAO, or should it just be a centralized org?</p>
<p>Here are some possible arguments for Gitcoin Grants to be a DAO:</p>
<ul>
<li>It holds and deals with cryptocurrency, because most of its users
and funders are Ethereum users</li>
<li>Secure quadratic funding is best done on-chain (see next section on
blockchain voting, and <a href="https://clr.fund/">implementation of
on-chain QF here</a>), so you reduce security risks if the result of the
vote feeds into the system directly</li>
<li>It deals with communities all around the world, and so benefits from
being <a href="https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/">credibly
neutral</a> and not centered around a single country.</li>
<li>It benefits from being able to give its users confidence that it
will still be around in five years, so that public goods funders can
start projects now and hope to be rewarded later.</li>
</ul>
<p>These arguments lean toward decentralization for robustness and
decentralization for interoperability of the superstructure, though the
individual quadratic funding rounds are more in the "decentralization
for efficiency" school of thought (the theory behind Gitcoin Grants is
that quadratic funding is a more efficient way to fund public
goods).</p>
<p>If the robustness and interoperability arguments did <em>not</em>
apply, then it probably would have been better to simply run Gitcoin
Grants as a regular company. But they do apply, and so Gitcoin Grants
being a DAO makes sense.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other examples of this kind of argument applying,
both for DAOs that people increasingly rely on for their day-to-day
lives, and for "meta-DAOs" that provide services to <em>other</em>
DAOs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proof of humanity</li>
<li><a href="https://kleros.io/">Kleros</a></li>
<li><a href="https://chain.link/">Chainlink</a></li>
<li>Stablecoins</li>
<li>Blockchain layer 2 protocol governance</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't know enough about all of these systems to testify that they
all <em>do</em> optimize for decentralization-for-robustness enough to
satisfy my standards, but hopefully it should be obvious by now that
they <em>should</em>.</p>
<p><strong>The main thing that <em>does not</em> work well are DAOs that
require pivoting ability that is in conflict with robustness, and that
do not have a sufficient case to "decentralize for efficiency"</strong>.
Large-scale companies that mainly interface with US users would be one
example. When making a DAO, the first thing is to determine whether or
not it is worth it to structure the project as a DAO, and the second
thing is to determine whether it's targeting robustness or efficiency:
if the former, deep thought into governance <em>design</em> is also
required, and if the latter, then either it's innovating on governance
via mechanisms like quadratic funding, or it should just be a
multisig.</p>
<h2 id="hybrid-applications">5. Hybrid applications</h2>
<p>There are many applications that are not entirely on-chain, but that
take advantage of both blockchains and other systems to improve their
trust models.</p>
<p><a href="../../../2021/05/25/voting2.html">Voting</a> is an excellent
example. High assurances of censorship resistance, auditability and
privacy are all required, and systems like <a
href="https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci">MACI</a>
effectively combine blockchains, ZK-SNARKs and a limited centralized (or
M-of-N) layer for scalability and coercion resistance to achieve all of
these guarantees. Votes are published to the blockchain, so users have a
way independent of the voting system to ensure that their votes get
included. But votes are encrypted, preserving privacy, and a
ZK-SNARK-based solution is used to ensure that the final result is the
correct computation of the votes.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/excited/maci2.png" /></p>
<p><small><i>Diagram of how MACI works, combining together blockchains
for censorship resistance, encryption for privacy, and ZK-SNARKs to
ensure the result is correct without compromising on the other
goals.</i></small></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Voting in existing national elections is already a high-assurance
process, and it will take a long time before countries and citizens are
comfortable with the security assurances of any electronic ways to vote,
blockchain or otherwise. But technology like this <em>can</em> be
valuable very soon in two other places:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Increasing the assurance of voting processes that already happen
electronically today (eg. social media votes, polls, petitions)</li>
<li>Creating new forms of voting that allow citizens or members of
groups to give rapid feedback, and baking high assurance into those from
the start</li>
</ol>
<p>Going beyond voting, there is an entire field of potential "auditable
centralized services" that could be well-served by some form of hybrid
off-chain <a
href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/validium/">validium</a>
architecture. The easiest example of this is <a
href="../../../2022/11/19/proof_of_solvency.html">proof of solvency for
exchanges</a>, but there are plenty of other possible examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Government registries</li>
<li>Corporate accounting</li>
<li>Games (see <a href="https://zkga.me/">Dark Forest</a> for an
example)</li>
<li>Supply chain applications</li>
<li>Tracking access authorization</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>As we go further down the list, we get to use cases that are lower
and lower value, but it is important to remember that these use cases
are also quite low cost. Validiums do not require publishing everything
on-chain. Rather, they can be simple wrappers around existing pieces of
software that maintain a Merkle root (or other commitment) of the
database and occasionally publish the root on-chain along with a SNARK
proving that it was updated correctly. This is a strict improvement over
existing systems, because it opens the door for cross-institutional
proofs and public auditing.</p>
<h2 id="so-how-do-we-get-there">So how do we get there?</h2>
<p>Many of these applications are being built today, though many of
these applications are seeing only limited usage because of the
limitations of present-day technology. Blockchains are not scalable,
transactions until recently took a fairly long time to reliably get
included on the chain, and present-day wallets give users an
uncomfortable choice between low convenience and low security. In the
longer term, many of these applications will need to overcome the
specter of privacy issues.</p>
<p>These are all problems that can be solved, and there is a strong
drive to solve them. The FTX collapse has shown many people the
importance of truly decentralized solutions to holding funds, and the
rise of <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337">ERC-4337</a>
and account abstraction wallets gives us an opportunity to create such
alternatives. Rollup technology is rapidly progressing to solve
scalability, and transactions already get included much more quickly
on-chain than they did three years ago.</p>
<p>But what is also important is to be intentional about the application
ecosystem itself. Many of the more stable and boring applications do not
get built because there is less excitement and less short-term profit to
be earned around them: the LUNA market cap got to over $30 billion,
while stablecoins striving for robustness and simplicity often get
largely ignored for years. Non-financial applications often have no hope
of earning $30 billion because they do not have a token at all. But it
is these applications that will be most valuable for the ecosystem in
the long term, and that will bring the most lasting value to both their
users and those who build and support them.</p>
