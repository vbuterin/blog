<title> On Nathan Schneider on the limits of cryptoeconomics </title>

<p>Nathan Schneider has recently released <a
href="https://osf.io/wzf85/?view_only=a10581ae9a804aa197ac39ebbba05766">an
article</a> describing his perspectives on cryptoeconomics, and
particularly on the limits of cryptoeconomic approaches to governance
and what cryptoeconomics could be augmented with to improve its
usefulness. This is, of course, a topic that is dear to me (<a
href="../../../2021/08/16/voting3.html">[1]</a> <a
href="../../../2020/09/11/coordination.html">[2]</a> <a
href="../../../2019/04/03/collusion.html">[3]</a> <a
href="../../../2018/03/28/plutocracy.html">[4]</a> <a
href="../../../2017/12/17/voting.html">[5]</a>), so it is heartening to
see someone else take the blockchain space seriously as an intellectual
tradition and engage with the issues from a different and unique
perspective.</p>
<p>The main question that Nathan's piece is trying to explore is simple.
There is a large body of intellectual work that criticizes a bubble of
concepts that they refer to as "economization", "neoliberalism" and
similar terms, arguing that they corrode democratic political values and
leave many people's needs unmet as a result. The world of cryptocurrency
is very economic (lots of tokens flying around everywhere, with lots of
functions being assigned to those tokens), very neo (the space is 12
years old!) and very liberal (freedom and voluntary participation are
core to the whole thing). Do these critiques also apply to blockchain
systems? If so, what conclusions should we draw, and how could
blockchain systems be designed to account for these critiques? Nathan's
answer: more hybrid approaches combining ideas from both economics and
politics. But what will it actually take to achieve that, and will it
give the results that we want? My answer: yes, but there's a lot of
subtleties involved.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-critiques-of-neoliberalism-and-economic-logic">What
are the critiques of neoliberalism and economic logic?</h2>
<p>Near the beginning of Nathan's piece, he describes the critiques of
overuse of economic logic briefly. That said, he does not go much
further into the underlying critiques himself, preferring to point to
other sources that have already covered the issue in depth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The economics in cryptoeconomics raises a particular set of
anxieties. Critics have long warned against the expansion of economic
logics, crowding out space for vigorous politics in public life. From
the Zapatista insurgents of southern Mexico (Hayden, 2002) to political
theorists like William Davies (2014) and Wendy Brown (2015), the
"neoliberal" aspiration for economics to guide all aspects of society
represents a threat to democratic governance and human personhood
itself. Here is Brown:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Neoliberalism transmogrifies every human domain and endeavor, along
with humans themselves, according to a specific image of the economic.
All conduct is economic conduct; all spheres of existence are framed and
measured by economic terms and metrics, even when those spheres are not
directly monetized. In neoliberal reason and in domains governed by it,
we are only and everywhere homo oeconomicus (p. 10)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Brown and other critics of neoliberalism, the ascent of the
economic means the decline of the political—the space for collective
determinations of the common good and the means of getting there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point, it's worth pointing out that the "neoliberalism" being
criticized here is not the same as the "neoliberalism" that is
cheerfully promoted by the <a
href="https://neoliberalproject.org/">lovely folks at The Neoliberal
Project</a>; the thing being critiqued here is a kind of "enough
two-party trade can solve everything" mentality, whereas The Neoliberal
Project favors a mix of markets and democracy. But what is the thrust of
the critique that Nathan is pointing to? What's the problem with
everyone acting much more like homo oeconomicus? For this, we can take a
detour and peek into the source, Wendy Brown's <a
href="https://erikafontanez.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/w.-brown-undoing-the-demos.pdf"><em>Undoing
the Demos</em></a>, itself. The book helpfully provides a list of the
top "four deleterious effects" (the below are reformatted and abridged
but direct quotes):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intensified inequality</strong>, in which the very top
strata acquires and retains ever more wealth, the very bottom is
literally turned out on the streets or into the growing urban and
sub-urban slums of the world, while the middle strata works more hours
for less pay, fewer benefits, less security...</li>
<li><strong>Crass or unethical commercialization</strong> of things and
activities considered inappropriate for marketization. The claim is that
marketization contributes to human exploitation or degradation, [...]
limits or stratifies access to what ought to be broadly accessible and
shared, [...] or because it enables something intrinsically horrific or
severely denigrating to the planet.</li>
<li><strong>Ever-growing intimacy of corporate and finance capital with
the state</strong>, and corporate domination of political decisions and
economic policy</li>
<li><strong>Economic havoc wreaked on the economy by the ascendance and
liberty of finance capital</strong>, especially the destabilizing
effects of the inherent bubbles and other dramatic fluctuations of
financial markets.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The bulk of Nathan's article follows along with analyses of how these
issues affect DAOs and governance mechanisms within the crypto space
specifically. Nathan focuses on three key problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plutocracy</strong>: "Those with more tokens than others
hold more [I would add, <em>disproportionately</em> more]
decision-making power than others..."</li>
<li><strong>Limited exposure to diverse motivations</strong>:
"Cryptoeconomics sees only a certain slice of the people involved.
Concepts such as self- sacrifice, duty, and honor are bedrock features
of most political and business organizations, but difficult to simulate
or approximate with cryptoeconomic incentive design"</li>
<li><strong>Positive and negative externalities</strong>: "Environmental
costs are classic externalities—invisible to the feedback loops that the
system understands and that communicate to its users as incentives ... the
challenge of funding"public goods" is another example of an externality
- and one that threatens the sustainability of crypteconomic
systems"</li>
</ul>
<p>The natural questions that arise for me are (i) to what extent do I
agree with this critique at all and how it fits in with my own thinking,
and (ii) how does this affect blockchains, and what do blockchain
protocols need to actually do to avoid these traps?</p>
<h3
id="what-do-i-think-of-the-critiques-of-neoliberalism-generally">What do
I think of the critiques of neoliberalism generally?</h3>
<p>I disagree with some, agree with others. I have always been
suspicious of criticism of "crass and unethical commercialization",
because it frequently feels like the author is attempting to launder
their own feelings of disgust and aesthetic preferences into grand
ethical and political ideologies - a sin common among all such
ideologies, often the right (<a
href="https://mobile.twitter.com/RokoMijic/status/1339321092238929920">random
example here</a>) even more than the left. Back in the days when I had
much less money and would sometimes walk a full hour to the airport to
avoid a taxi fare, I remember thinking that I would love to get
compensated for donating blood or using my body for clinical trials. And
so to me, the idea that such transactions are inhuman exploitation has
never been appealing.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I am far from a <a
href="https://cdn.mises.org/Defending_the_Undefendable_2018.pdf">Walter
Block-style defender</a> of <em>all</em> locally-voluntary two-party
commerce. I've written up my own viewpoints expressing similar concerns
to parts of Wendy Brown's list in various articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../2018/03/28/plutocracy.html">Multiple</a> pieces <a
href="../../../2019/04/03/collusion.html">decrying</a> the evils of vote
buying, or even <a href="../../../2021/08/16/voting3.html">financialized
governance generally</a></li>
<li>The <a href="../../../2019/12/07/quadratic.html">importance</a> of
<a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/0f9aa81e">public goods
funding</a>.</li>
<li>Failure modes in financial markets due to <a
href="../../../2021/02/18/election.html">subtle issues like capital
efficiency</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So where does <em>my own</em> opposition to mixing finance and
governance come from? This is a complicated topic, and my conclusions
are in large part a result of my own failure after years of attempts to
<em>find</em> a financialized governance mechanism that is economically
stable. So here goes...</p>
<h2 id="finance-is-the-absence-of-collusion-prevention">Finance is the
absence of collusion prevention</h2>
<p>Out of the standard assumptions in what gets pejoratively called
"spherical cow economics", people normally tend to focus on the
unrealistic nature of <em>perfect information</em> and <em>perfect
rationality</em>. But the unrealistic assumption that is hidden in the
list that strikes me as even more misleading is <em>individual
choice</em>: the idea that each agent is separately making their own
decisions, no agent has a positive or negative stake in another agent's
outcomes, and there are no "side games"; the only thing that sees each
agent's decisions is the black box that we call "the mechanism".</p>
<center>
<p><img src="../../../../images/limits/spherical_cow.png"
class="padded" /></p>
</center>
<p>This assumption is often used to bootstrap complex contraptions such
as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey%E2%80%93Clarke%E2%80%93Groves_mechanism">the
VCG mechanism</a>, whose theoretical optimality is based on beautiful
arguments that because the price each player pays only depends on
<em>other players' bids</em>, each player has no incentive to make a bid
that does not reflect their true value in order to manipulate the price.
A beautiful argument in theory, but it breaks down completely once you
introduce the possibility that even two of the players are either allies
or adversaries outside the mechanism.</p>
<p>Economics, and economics-inspired philosophy, is great at describing
the complexities that arise when the number of players "playing the
game" increases from one to two (see the tale of Crusoe and Friday in
Murray Rothbard's <a
href="https://mises.org/library/crusoe-social-philosophy">The Ethics of
Liberty</a> for one example). But what this philosophical tradition
completely misses is that going up to <em>three</em> players adds an
even further layer of complexity. In an interaction between two people,
the two can ignore each other, fight or trade. In an interaction between
three people, there exists a new strategy: any two of the three can
communicate and band together to gang up on the third. Three is the
smallest denominator where it's possible to talk about a 51%+ attack
that has someone outside the clique to be a victim.</p>
<p><strong>When there's only two people, more coordination can only be
good. But once there's three people, the wrong kind of coordination <a
href="../../../2020/09/11/coordination.html">can be harmful</a>, and
techniques to <em>prevent</em> harmful coordination (<a
href="../../../2017/05/08/coordination_problems.html">including
decentralization itself</a>) can become very valuable. And it's this
management of coordination that is the essence of
"politics".</strong></p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/round4-files/threelayer.png"

<p><br><small><i>Going from two people to three introduces the
possibility of harms from unbalanced coordination: it's not just "the
individual versus the group", it's "the individual versus the group
versus the world". </i></small><br><br></p>
</center>
<p>Now, we can understand try to use this framework to understand the
pitfalls of "finance". <strong>Finance can be viewed as a set of
patterns that naturally emerge in many kinds of systems that do not
attempt to prevent collusion.</strong> Any system which <em>claims</em>
to be non-finance, but does not actually make an effort to prevent
collusion, will eventually acquire the characteristics of finance, if
not something worse. To see why this is the case, compare two point
systems we are all familiar with: money, and Twitter likes. Both kinds
of points are valuable for extrinsic reasons, both have inevitably
become status symbols, and both are number games where people spend a
lot of time optimizing to try to get a higher score. And yet, they
behave very differently. So what's the fundamental difference between
the two?</p>
<p>The answer is simple: it's the lack of an efficient market to enable
agreements like "I like your tweet if you like mine", or "I like your
tweet if you pay me in some other currency". If such a market existed
and was easy to use, Twitter would collapse completely (something like
hyperinflation would happen, with the likely outcome that everyone would
run automated bots that like every tweet to claim rewards), and even the
likes-for-money markets that exist illicitly <em>today</em> are a big
problem for Twitter. With money, however, "I send X to you if you send Y
to me" is not an <em>attack vector</em>, it's just a boring old currency
exchange transaction. A Twitter clone that does not prevent
like-for-like markets would "hyperinflate" into everyone liking
everything, and if that Twitter clone tried to stop the hyperinflation
by limiting the number of likes each user can make, the likes would
behave like a currency, and the end result would behave the same as if
Twitter just added a tipping feature.</p>
<p>So what's the problem with finance? Well, if finance is optimized and
structured collusion, then we can look for places where finance causes
problems by using our existing economic tools to understand which
mechanisms break if you introduce collusion! Unfortunately, governance
by voting is a central example of this category; I've covered why in the
<a href="../../../2021/08/16/voting3.html#degov-is-dangerous">"moving
beyond coin voting governance" post</a> and <a
href="../../../2018/03/28/plutocracy.html">many</a> other <a
href="../../../2019/04/03/collusion.html">occasions</a>. Even worse,
cooperative game theory suggests that there might be <a
href="../../../2020/09/11/coordination.html#understanding-the-game-theory">no
possible way to make a fully collusion-resistant governance
mechanism</a>.</p>
<p>And so we get the fundamental conundrum: the cypherpunk spirit is
fundamentally about making maximally immutable systems that work with as
little information as possible about who is participating ("on the
internet, nobody knows you're a dog"), but making new forms of
<em>governance</em> requires the system to have richer information about
its participants and ability to dynamically respond to attacks in order
to remain stable in the face of actors with unforeseen incentives.
Failure to do this means that everything looks like finance, which
means, well.... perennial over-representation of concentrated interests,
and all the problems that come as a result.</p>

<h2
id="the-central-role-of-collusion-in-understanding-the-difference-between-kleros-and-regular-courts">The
central role of collusion in understanding the difference between Kleros
and regular courts</h2>
<p>Now, let us get back to Nathan's article. The distinction between
financial and non-financial mechanisms is key in the article. Let us
start off with a description of the Kleros court:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The jurors stood to earn rewards by correctly choosing the answer
that they expected other jurors to independently select. This process
implements the "Schelling point" concept in game theory (Aouidef et al.,
2021; Dylag &amp; Smith, 2021). Such a jury does not deliberate, does
not seek a common good together; its members unite through
self-interest. Before coming to the jury, the factual basis of the case
was supposed to come not from official organs or respected news
organizations but from anonymous users similarly disciplined by
reward-seeking. The prediction market itself was premised on the
supposition that people make better forecasts when they stand to gain or
lose the equivalent of money in the process. The politics of the
presidential election in question, here, had been thoroughly transmuted
into a cluster of economies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The implicit critique is clear: the Kleros court is ultimately
motivated to make decisions not on the basis of their "true" correctness
or incorrectness, but rather on the basis of their financial interests.
If Kleros is deciding whether Biden or Trump won the 2020 election, and
one Kleros juror really likes Trump, precommits to voting in his favor,
and bribes other jurors to vote the same way, other jurors are likely to
fall in line because of Kleros's conformity incentives: jurors are
rewarded if their vote agrees with the majority vote, and penalized
otherwise. The theoretical answer to this is the right to exit: if the
majority of Kleros jurors vote to proclaim that Trump won the election,
a minority can spin off a fork of Kleros where Biden is considered to
have won, and their fork may well get a higher market price than the
original. Sometimes, <a
href="../../../2021/03/23/legitimacy.html#coins-can-be-owned-by-social-contracts">this
actually works</a>! But, as Nathan points out, it is not always so
simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But exit may not be as easy as it appears, whether it be from a
social-media network or a protocol. The persistent dominance of
early-to-market blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum suggests that
cryptoeconomics similarly favors incumbency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But alongside the implicit critique is an implicit promise: that
<em>regular courts</em> are somehow able to rise above self-interest and
"seek a common good together" and thereby avoid some of these failure
modes. What is it that financialized Kleros courts lack, but
non-financialized regular courts retain, that makes them more robust?
One possible answer is that courts lack Kleros's explicit conformity
incentive. But if you just take Kleros as-is, remove the conformity
incentive (say, there's a reward for voting that does not depend on how
you vote), and do nothing else, you risk creating even more problems.
Kleros judges could get lazy, but more importantly if there's no
incentive at all to choose how you vote, even the tiniest bribe could
affect a judge's decision.</p>
<p>So now we get to the real answer: the key difference between
financialized Kleros courts and non-financialized regular courts is that
financialized Kleros courts are, well... <em>financialized</em>. They make
no effort to explicitly prevent collusion. Non-financialized courts, on
the other hand, do prevent collusion in two key ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bribing a judge to vote in a particular way is explicitly
illegal</li>
<li>The judge position itself is non-fungible. It gets awarded to
specific carefully-selected individuals, and they cannot simply go and
sell or reallocate their entire judging rights and salary to someone
else.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only reason why political and legal systems work is that a lot of
hard thinking and work has gone on behind the scenes to <em>insulate the
decision-makers from extrinsic incentives</em>, and punish them
explicitly if they are discovered to be accepting incentives from the
outside. <strong>The lack of extrinsic motivation allows the intrinsic
motivation to shine through. Furthermore, the lack of transferability
allows governance power to be given to specific actors whose intrinsic
motivations we trust, avoiding governance power always flowing to "the
highest bidder".</strong> But in the case of Kleros, the lack of hostile
extrinsic motivation cannot be guaranteed, and transferability is
unavoidable, and so overpoweringly strong in-mechanism extrinsic
motivation (the conformity incentive) was the best solution they could
find to deal with the problem.</p>
<p>And of course, the "final backstop" that Kleros relies on, the right
of users to fork away, itself depends on social coordination to take
place - a messy and difficult institution, often derided by
cryptoeconomic purists as "proof of social media", that works precisely
because public discussion has lots of informal collusion detection and
prevention all over the place.</p>
<h2 id="collusion-in-understanding-dao-governance-issues">Collusion in
understanding DAO governance issues</h2>
<p>But what happens when there is no single right answer that they can
expect voters to converge on? This is where we move away from
<em>adjudication</em> and toward <em>governance</em> (yes, I know that
adjudication has unavoidably grey edge cases too. Governance just has
them much more often). Nathan writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Governance by economics is nothing new. Joint-stock companies
conventionally operate on plutocratic governance—more shares equals more
votes. This arrangement is economically efficient for aligning
shareholder interests (Davidson and Potts, this issue), even while it
may sideline such externalities as fair wages and environmental
impacts...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my opinion, this actually concedes too much! Governance by
economics is not "efficient" once you drop the spherical-cow assumption
of no collusion, because it is inherently vulnerable to 51% of the
stakeholders colluding to liquidate the company and split its resources
among themselves. The only reason why this does not happen much more
often "in real life" is because of many decades of shareholder
regulation that have been explicitly built up to ban the most common
types of abuses. This regulation is, of course, non-"economic" (or, in
my lingo, it makes corporate governance less <em>financialized</em>),
because it's an explicit attempt to prevent collusion.</p>
<p>Notably, Nathan's favored solutions do <em>not</em> try to regulate
coin voting. Instead, they try to limit the harms of its weaknesses by
combining it with additional mechanisms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rather than relying on direct token voting, as other protocols have
done, The Graph uses a board-like mediating layer, the Graph Council, on
which the protocol's major stakeholder groups have representatives. In
this case, the proposal had the potential to favor one group of
stakeholders over others, and passing a decision through the Council
requires multiple stakeholder groups to agree. At the same time, the
Snapshot vote put pressure on the Council to implement the will of
token-holders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the case of 1Hive, the anti-financialization protections are
described as being purely cultural:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to a slogan that appears repeatedly in 1Hive discussions,
"Come for the honey, stay for the bees." That is, although economics
figures prominently as one first encounters and explores 1Hive,
participants understand the community's primary value as interpersonal,
social, and non-economic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am personally skeptical of the latter approach: it can work well in
low-economic-value communities that are fun oriented, but if such an
approach is attempted in a more serious system with widely open
participation and enough at stake to invite determined attack, it will
not survive for long. As I wrote above, "any system which
<em>claims</em> to be non-finance, but does not actually make an effort
to prevent collusion, will eventually acquire the characteristics of
finance".</p>
<p><strong>[Edit/correction 2021.09.27: it has been brought to my
attention that in addition to culture, financialization <a
href="https://gardens.substack.com/p/introducing-gardens">is limited
by</a> (i) conviction voting, and (ii) juries enforcing a covenant. I'm
skeptical of conviction voting in the long run; many DAOs use it today,
but in the long term it can be <a

href="https://thegraph.com/blog/introducing-the-graph-council">participants
have been hand-picked</a> to come from diverse constituencies and to be
trusted and upstanding people who are unlikely to sell their voting
rights. Hence, I am bullish on that approach if it successfully avoids
centralization.</p>
<h2 id="so-how-can-we-solve-these-problems-more-generally">So how can we
solve these problems more generally?</h2>
<p>Nathan's post argues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A napkin sketch of classical, never-quite-achieved liberal democracy
(Brown, 2015) would depict a market (governed through economic
incentives) enclosed in politics (governed through deliberation on the
common good). Economics has its place, but the system is not economics
all the way down; the rules that guide the market, and that enable it in
the first place, are decided democratically, on the basis of citizens'
civil rights rather than their economic power. By designing democracy
into the base-layer of the system, it is possible to overcome the kinds
of limitations that cryptoeconomics is vulnerable to, such as by
counteracting plutocracy with mass participation and making visible the
externalities that markets might otherwise fail to see.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is one key difference between blockchain political theory and
traditional nation-state political theory - and one where, in the long
run, nation states may well have to learn from blockchains. Nation-state
political theory talks about "markets embedded in democracy" as though
democracy is an encompassing base layer that encompasses all of society.
In reality, this is not true: there are multiple countries, and every
country at least to some degree permits trade with outside countries
whose behavior they cannot regulate. Individuals and companies have
choices about which countries they live in and do business in. Hence,
markets are not just embedded in democracy, they also surround it, and
the real world is a complicated interplay between the two.</p>
<p>Blockchain systems, instead of trying to fight this
interconnectedness, embrace it. A blockchain system has no ability to
regular "the market" in the sense of people's general ability to freely
make transactions. But what it <em>can</em> do is regulate and structure
(or even create) specific markets, setting up patterns of specific
behaviors whose incentives are ultimately set and guided by institutions
that have anti-collusion guardrails built in, and can resist pressure
from economic actors. And indeed, this is the direction Nathan ends up
going in as well. He talks positively about the design of Civil as an
example of precisely this spirit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The aborted Ethereum-based project Civil sought to leverage
cryptoeconomics to protect journalism against censorship and degraded
professional standards (Schneider, 2020). Part of the system was the
Civil Council, a board of prominent journalists who served as a kind of
supreme court for adjudicating the practices of the network's newsrooms.
Token holders could earn rewards by successfully challenging a
newsroom's practices; the success or failure of a challenge ultimately
depended on the judgment of the Civil Council, designed to be free of
economic incentives clouding its deliberations. In this way, a
cryptoeconomic enforcement market served a non-economic social mission.
This kind of design could enable cryptoeconomic networks to serve
purposes not reducible to economic feedback loops.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is fundamentally very similar to an idea that I proposed in
2018: <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/prediction-markets-for-content-curation-daos/1312">prediction
markets to scale up content moderation</a>. Instead of doing content
moderation by running a low-quality AI algorithm on all content, with
lots of false positives, there could be an open mini prediction market
on each post, and if the volume got high enough a high-quality committee
could step in an adjudicate, and the prediction market participants
would be penalized or rewarded based on whether or not they had
correctly predicted the outcome. In the mean time, posts with prediction
market scores predicting that the post would be removed would not be
shown to users who did not explicitly opt-in to participate in the
prediction game. There is precedent for this kind of open but
accountable moderation: <a
href="https://slashdot.org/faq/metamod.shtml">Slashdot meta
moderation</a> is arguably a limited version of it. This more
financialized version of meta-moderation through prediction markets
could produce superior outcomes because the incentives invite highly
competent and professional participants to take part.</p>
<p>Nathan then expands:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have argued that pairing cryptoeconomics with political systems can
help overcome the limitations that bedevil cryptoeconomic governance
alone. Introducing purpose-centric mechanisms and temporal modulation
can compensate for the blind-spots of token economies. But I am not
arguing against cryptoeconomics altogether. Nor am I arguing that these
sorts of politics must occur in every app and protocol. Liberal
democratic theory permits diverse forms of association and business
within a democratic structure, and similarly politics may be necessary
only at key leverage points in an ecosystem to overcome the limitations
of cryptoeconomics alone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems broadly correct. Financialization, as Nathan points out in
his conclusion, has benefits in that it attracts a large amount of
motivation and energy into building and participating in systems that
would not otherwise exist. Furthermore, <em>preventing</em>
financialization is very difficult and high cost, and works best when
done sparingly, where it is needed most. However, it is also true that
financialized systems are much more stable if their incentives are
anchored around a system that is ultimately non-financial.</p>
<p>Prediction markets avoid the plutocracy issues inherent in coin
voting because they introduce <em>individual accountability</em>: users
who acted in favor of what ultimately turns out to be a bad decision
suffer more than users who acted against it. However, a prediction
market requires some statistic that it is measuring, and measurement
oracles cannot be made secure through cryptoeconomics alone: at the very
least, community forking as a backstop against attacks is required. And
if we want to avoid the messiness of frequent forks, some other explicit
non-financialized mechanism at the center is a valuable alternative.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>In his conclusion, Nathan writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the autonomy of cryptoeconomic systems from external regulation
could make them even more vulnerable to runaway feedback loops, in which
narrow incentives overpower the common good. The designers of these
systems have shown an admirable capacity to devise cryptoeconomic
mechanisms of many kinds. But for cryptoeconomics to achieve the
institutional scope its advocates hope for, it needs to make space for
less-economic forms of governance.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If cryptoeconomics needs a political layer, and is no longer
self-sufficient, what good is cryptoeconomics? One answer might be that
cryptoeconomics can be the basis for securing more democratic and
values-centered governance, where incentives can reduce reliance on
military or police power. Through mature designs that integrate with
less-economic purposes, cryptoeconomics might transcend its initial
limitations. Politics needs cryptoeconomics, too ... by integrating
cryptoeconomics with democracy, both legacies seem poised to
benefit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I broadly agree with both conclusions. The language of collusion
prevention can be helpful for understanding <em>why</em> cryptoeconomic
purism so severely constricts the design space. "Finance" is a category
of patterns that emerge when systems do not attempt to prevent
collusion. When a system does not prevent collusion, it cannot treat
different individuals differently, or even different <em>numbers</em> of
individuals differently: whenever a "position" to exert influence
exists, the owner of that position can just sell it to the highest
bidder.</p>

<p>The language of <a
href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/a-proof-of-stake-design-philosophy-506585978d51">defense-focused
design</a>, on the other hand, is an underrated way to think about where
some of the <em>advantages</em> of blockchain-based designs can be.
Nation state systems often deal with threats with one of two totalizing
mentalities: <em>closed borders</em> vs <em>conquer the world</em>. A
closed borders approach attempts to make hard distinctions between an
"inside" that the system <em>can</em> regulate and an "outside" that the
system cannot, severely restricting flow between the inside and the
outside. Conquer-the-world approaches attempt to extraterritorialize a
nation state's preferences, seeking a state of affairs where there is no
place in the entire world where some undesired activity can happen.
Blockchains are structurally unable to take either approach, and so they
must seek alternatives.</p>
<p>Fortunately, blockchains do have one very powerful tool in their
grasp that makes security under such porous conditions actually
feasible: <em>cryptography</em>. Cryptography allows everyone to verify
that some governance procedure was executed exactly according to the
rules. It leaves a verifiable evidence trail of all actions, though zero
knowledge proofs allow mechanism designers freedom in picking and
choosing exactly what evidence is visible and what evidence is not.
Cryptography can even <a href="../../../2021/05/25/voting2.html">prevent
collusion</a>! Blockchains allow applications to live on a substrate
that their governacne does not control, which allows them to effectively
implement techniques such as, for example, ensure that every change to
the rules only takes effect with a 60 day delay. Finally, freedom to
fork is much more practical, and forking is much lower in economic and
human cost, than most centralized systems.</p>
<p>Blockchain-based contraptions have a lot to offer the world that
other kinds of systems do not. On the other hand, Nathan is completely
correct to emphasize that <em>blockchainized</em> should not be equated
with <em>financialized</em>. There is plenty of room for
blockchain-based systems that do not look like money, and indeed we need
more of them.</p>
