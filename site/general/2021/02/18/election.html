<title> Prediction Markets: Tales from the Election </title>

<p><em>Special thanks to Jeff Coleman, Karl Floersch and Robin Hanson
for critical feedback and review.</em></p>
<p><em>Trigger warning: I express some political opinions.</em></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Prediction markets are a subject that has interested me for many
years. The idea of allowing anyone in the public to make bets about
future events, and using the odds at which these bets are made as a <a
href="https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/">credibly</a> <a
href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/2013/01/hail-scott.html">neutral</a>
source of predicted probabilities of these events, is a fascinating
application of mechanism design. Closely related ideas, like <a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/08/21/introduction-futarchy/">futarchy</a>,
have always interested me as innovative tools that could improve
governance and decision-making. And as <a
href="https://augur2.eth.link/">Augur</a> and <a
href="https://omen.eth.link/">Omen</a>, and more recently <a
href="https://polymarket.com/">PolyMarket</a>, have shown, prediction
markets are a fascinating application of blockchains (in all three
cases, Ethereum) as well.</p>
<p>And the 2020 US presidential election, it seems like prediction
markets are finally entering the limelight, with blockchain-based
markets in particular growing from near-zero in 2016 to <a
href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/83520/u-s-2020-election-boosts-use-of-decentralized-prediction-markets">millions
of dollars of volume in 2020</a>. As someone who is closely interested
in seeing Ethereum applications cross the chasm into widespread
adoption, this of course aroused my interest. At first, I was inclined
to simply watch, and not participate myself: I am not an expert on US
electoral politics, so why should I expect my opinion to be more correct
than that of everyone else who was already trading? But in my
Twitter-sphere, I saw more and more arguments from Very Smart People
whom I respected arguing that the markets <em>were</em> in fact being
irrational and I <em>should</em> participate and bet against them if I
can. Eventually, I was convinced.</p>
<p>I decided to make an experiment on the blockchain that I helped to
create: I bought $2,000 worth of NTRUMP (tokens that pay $1 if Trump
loses) on Augur. Little did I know then that my position would
eventually increase to $308,249, earning me a profit of over $56,803,
and that I would make all of these remaining bets, against willing
counterparties, <em>after Trump had already lost the election</em>. What
would transpire over the next two months would prove to be a fascinating
case study in social psychology, expertise, arbitrage, and the limits of
market efficiency, with important ramifications to anyone who is deeply
interested in the possibilities of economic institution design.</p>
<h2 id="before-the-election">Before the Election</h2>
<br>

<br>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>My first bet on this election was actually not on a blockchain at
all. When <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West_2020_presidential_campaign">Kanye
announced his presidential bid</a> in July, a political theorist whom I
ordinarily quite respect for his high-quality and original thinking
immediately claimed on Twitter that he was confident that this would
split the anti-Trump vote and lead to a Trump victory. I remember
thinking at the time that this particular opinion of his was
over-confident, perhaps even a result of over-internalizing the
heuristic that if a viewpoint seems clever and contrarian then it is
likely to be correct. So <a
href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/11/a-bet-is-a-tax-on-bullshit.html">of
course</a> I offered to make a $200 bet, myself betting the boring
conventional pro-Biden view, and he honorably accepted.</p>
<p>The election came up again on my radar in September, and this time it
was the prediction markets that caught my attention. The markets gave
Trump a nearly 50% chance of winning, but I saw many Very Smart People
in my Twitter-sphere whom I respected pointing out that this number
seemed far too high. This of course led to the familiar "efficient
markets debate": if you can buy a token that gives you $1 if Trump loses
for $0.52, and Trump's actual chance of losing is much higher, why
wouldn't people just come in and buy the token until the price rises
more? And if nobody has done this, who are you to think that you're
smarter than everyone else?</p>
<p>Ne0liberal's <a
href="https://threader.app/thread/1323549077829799937">Twitter thread
just before Election Day</a> does an excellent job summarizing his case
against prediction markets being accurate at that time. In short, the
(non-blockchain) prediction markets that most people used at least prior
to 2020 have all sorts of restrictions that make it difficult for people
to participate with more than a small amount of cash. As a result, if a
very smart individual or a professional organization saw a probability
that they believed was wrong, they would only have a very limited
ability to push the price in the direction that they believe to be
correct.</p>
<p>The most important restrictions that the paper points out are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low limits (well under $1,000) on how much each person can bet</li>
<li>High fees (eg. a 5% withdrawal fee on PredictIt)</li>
</ul>
<p>And this is where I <a
href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1301313579203715073">pushed
back against ne0liberal in September</a>: although the stodgy old-world
centralized prediction markets may have low limits and high fees, the
crypto markets do not! On Augur or Omen, there's no limit to how much
someone can buy or sell if they think the price of some outcome token is
too low or too high. And the blockchain-based prediction markets were
following the same prices as PredictIt. If the markets really were
over-estimating Trump because high fees and low trading limits were
preventing the more cool-headed traders from outbidding the overly
optimistic ones, then why would blockchain-based markets, which don't
have those issues, show the same prices?</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>The main response my Twitter friends gave to this was that
blockchain-based markets are highly niche, and very few people,
particularly very few people who know much about politics, have easy
access to cryptocurrency. That seemed plausible, but I was not
<em>too</em> confident in that argument. And so I bet $2,000 against
Trump and went no further.</p>
<h2 id="the-election">The Election</h2>
<p>Then the election happened. After an initial scare where Trump at
first won more seats than we expected, Biden turned out to be the
eventual winner. Whether or not the election itself validated or refuted
the efficiency of prediction markets is a topic that, as far as I can
tell, is quite open to interpretation. On the one hand, by a standard <a
href="https://arbital.com/p/bayes_rule_guide/">Bayes rule</a>
application, I should decrease my confidence of prediction markets, at
least relative to Nate Silver. Prediction markets gave a 60% chance of
Biden winning, Nate Silver gave a <a
href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/">90%
chance of Biden winning</a>. Since Biden in fact won, this is one piece
of evidence that I live in a world where Nate gives the more correct
answers.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, you can make a case that the prediction
markets bettter estimated the <em>margin</em> of victory. The median of
Nate's probability distribution was somewhere around 370 of 538
electoral college votes going to Biden:</p>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/election-files/nate_biden.png" />
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Trump markets didn't give a probability distribution, but if you
<em>had to</em> guess a probability distribution from the statistic "40%
chance Trump will win", you would probably give one with a median
somewhere around 300 EC votes for Biden. The actual result: 306. So the
net score for prediction markets vs Nate seems to me, on reflection,
ambiguous.</p>
<h2 id="after-the-election">After the election</h2>
<p>But what I could not have imagined at the time was that the election
itself was just the beginning. A few days after the election, Biden was
declared the winner by various major organizations and even a few
foreign governments. Trump mounted various legal challenges to the
election results, as was expected, but each of these challenges <a
href="https://www.ft.com/content/20b114b5-5419-493b-9923-a918a2527931">quickly
failed</a>. But for over a month, <em>the price of the NTRUMP tokens
stayed at 85 cents</em>!</p>
<p>At the beginning, it seemed reasonable to guess that Trump had a 15%
chance of overturning the results; after all, he had appointed <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Supreme_Court_candidates">three
judges</a> to the Supreme Court, at a time of heightened partisanship
where many have come to favor team over principle. Over the next three
weeks, however, it became more and more clear that the challenges were
failing, and Trump's hopes continued to look grimmer with each passing
day, but the NTRUMP price did not budge; in fact, it even briefly
<em>decreased</em> to around $0.82. On December 11, more than five weeks
after the election, the <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/11/supreme-court-rejects-trump-backed-texas-lawsuit-aiming-to-overturn-election-results">Supreme
Court decisively and unanimously rejected</a> Trump's attempts to
overturn the vote, and the NTRUMP price finally rose.... to $0.88.</p>
<p>It was in November that I was finally convinced that the market
skeptics were right, and I plunged in and bet against Trump myself. The
decision was not so much about the money; after all, barely two months
later I would <a
href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1356177116744839169">earn
and donate to GiveDirectly</a> a far larger amount simply from holding
dogecoin. Rather, it was to take part in the experiment not just as an
observer, but as an active participant, and improve my personal
understanding of why everyone else hadn't already plunged in to buy
NTRUMP tokens before me.</p>
<h3 id="dipping-in">Dipping in</h3>
<p>I bought my NTRUMP on <a
href="https://catnip1.netlify.app/">Catnip</a>, a front-end user
interface that combines together the Augur prediction market with <a
href="https://balancer.exchange">Balancer</a>, a <a
href="https://medium.com/bollinger-investment-group/constant-function-market-makers-defis-zero-to-one-innovation-968f77022159">Uniswap-style
constant-function market maker</a>. Catnip was by far the easiest
interface for making these trades, and in my opinion contributed
significantly to Augur's usability.</p>
<p>There are two ways to bet against Trump with Catnip:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Use <a href="https://makerdao.com/en/">DAI</a> to buy NTRUMP on
Catnip directly</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://foundry.finance">Foundry</a> to access an Augur
feature that allows you to convert 1 DAI into 1 NTRUMP + 1 YTUMP +
1ITRUMP (the "I" stands for "invalid", more on this later), and sell the
YTRUMP on Catnip</li>
</ol>
<p>At first, I only knew about the first option. But then I discovered
that Balancer has far more liquidity for YTRUMP, and so I switched to
the second option.</p>
<p>There was also another problem: I did not have any DAI. I had ETH,
and I could have sold my ETH to get DAI, but I did not want to sacrifice
my ETH exposure; it would have been a shame if I earned $50,000 betting
against Trump but simultaneously lost $500,000 missing out on ETH price
changes. So I decided to keep my ETH price exposure the same by opening
up a collateralized debt position (CDP, now also called a "<a
href="https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/vaults/">vault</a>")
on MakerDAO.</p>
<p>A CDP is how all DAI is generated: users deposit their ETH into a
smart contract, and are allowed to withdraw an amount of newly-generated
DAI up to 2/3 of the value of ETH that they put in. They can get their
ETH back by sending back the same amount of DAI that they withdrew plus
an extra interest fee (currently 3.5%). If the value of the ETH
collateral that you deposited drops to less than 150% the value of the
DAI you withdrew, anyone can come in and "<a
href="https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/vaults/liquidation/">liquidate</a>"
the vault, forcibly selling the ETH to buy back the DAI and charging you
a high penalty. Hence, it's a good idea to have a high collateralization
ratio in case of sudden price movements; I had over $3 worth of ETH in
my CDP for every $1 that I withdrew.</p>
<p>Recapping the above, here's the pipeline in diagram form:</p>
<br>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/election-files/pipeline.png" class="padded" />
</center>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>I did this many times; the slippage on Catnip meant that I could
normally make trades only up to about $5,000 to $10,000 at a time
without prices becoming too unfavorable (when I had skipped Foundry and
bought NTRUMP with DAI directly, the limit was closer to $1,000). And
after two months, I had accumulated over 367,000 NTRUMP.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-everyone-else">Why not everyone else?</h2>
<p>Before I went in, I had four main hypotheses about why so few others
were buying up dollars for 85 cents:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Fear that either the Augur smart contracts would break or Trump
supporters would manipulate the oracle (a <a
href="https://augur.net/blog/v2-resolution/">decentralized mechanism</a>
where holders of Augur's REP token vote by staking their tokens on one
outcome or the other) to make it return a false result</li>
<li>Capital costs: to buy these tokens, you have to lock up funds for
over two months, and this removes your ability to spend those funds or
make other profitable trades for that duration</li>
<li>It's too technically complicated for almost everyone to trade</li>
<li>There just really are far fewer people than I thought who are
actually motivated enough to take a weird opportunity even when it
presents them straight in the face</li>
</ol>
<p>All four have reasonable arguments going for them. Smart contracts
breaking <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)">is</a> <a
href="https://www.parity.io/a-postmortem-on-the-parity-multi-sig-library-self-destruct/">a</a>
<a
href="https://hackingdistributed.com/2020/03/11/flash-loans/">real</a>
<a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/06/19/thinking-smart-contract-security/">risk</a>,
and the Augur oracle had not before been tested in such a contentious
environment. Capital costs are real, and while betting against something
is easier in a prediction market than in a stock market because you know
that prices will never go above $1, locking up capital nevertheless
competes with other lucrative opportunities in the crypto markets.
Making transactions things in dapps <em>is</em> technically complicated,
and it's rational to have some degree of fear-of-the-unknown.</p>
<p>But my experience actually going into the financial trenches, and
watching the prices on this market evolve, taught me a lot about each of
these hypotheses.</p>
<h3 id="fear-of-smart-contract-exploits">Fear of smart contract
exploits</h3>
<p>At first, I thought that "fear of smart contract exploits" must have
been a significant part of the explanation. But over time, I have become
more convinced that it is probably <em>not</em> a dominant factor. One
way to see why I think this is the case is to compare the prices for
YTRUMP and ITRUMP. ITRUMP stands for "Invalid Trump"; "Invalid" is an
event outcome that is intended to be triggered in <a
href="https://help.augur.net/trading/trading-faq#what-does-invalid-mean">some
exceptional cases</a>: when the description of the event is ambiguous,
when the outcome of the event is not yet known when the market is
resolved, when the market is unethical (eg. assassination markets), and
a few other similar situations. In this market, the price of ITRUMP
consistently stayed under $0.02. If someone wanted to earn a profit by
attacking the market, it would be far more lucrative for them to not buy
YTRUMP at $0.15, but instead buy ITRUMP at $0.02. If they buy a large
amount of ITRUMP, they could earn a 50x return if they can force the
"invalid" outcome to actually trigger. So if you fear an attack, buying
ITRUMP is by far the most rational response. And yet, very few people
did.</p>
<p>A further argument against fear of smart contract exploits, of
course, is the fact that in every crypto application <em>except</em>
prediction markets (eg. Compound, the various yield farming schemes)
people are surprisingly blasé about smart contract risks. If people are
willing to put their money into all sorts of risky and untested schemes
even for a promise of mere 5-8% annual gains, why would they suddenly
become over-cautious here?</p>
<h3 id="capital-costs">Capital costs</h3>
<p>Capital costs - the inconvenience and opportunity cost of locking up
large amounts of money - are a challenge that I have come to appreciate
much more than I did before. Just looking at the Augur side of things, I
needed to lock up 308,249 DAI for an average of about two months to make
a $56,803 profit. This works out to about a 175% annualized interest
rate; so far, quite a good deal, even compared to the various yield
farming crazes of the summer of 2020. But this becomes worse when you
take into account what I needed to do on MakerDAO. Because I wanted to
keep my exposure to ETH the same, I needed to get my DAI through a CDP,
and safely using a CDP required a collateral ratio of over 3x. Hence,
the total amount of capital I <em>actually</em> needed to lock up was
somewhere around a million dollars.</p>
<br>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/election-files/winnings.png" style="width:50%" class="padded" /><br>
</center>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>Now, the interest rates are looking less favorable. And if you add to
that the possibility, however remote, that a smart contract hack, or a
truly unprecedented political event, actually <em>will</em> happen, it
looks less favorable still.</p>
<p>But even still, assuming a 3x lockup and a 3% chance of Augur
breaking (I had bought ITRUMP to cover the possibility that it breaks in
the "invalid" direction, so I needed only worry about the risk of breaks
in the "yes" direction or the the funds being stolen outright), that
works out to a risk-neutral rate of about 35%, and even lower once you
take real human beings' views on risk into account. The deal is still
very attractive, but on the other hand, it now looks very understandable
that such numbers are unimpressive to people who live and breathe
cryptocurrency with its frequent 100x ups and downs.</p>
<p>Trump <em>supporters</em>, on the other hand, faced none of these
challenges: they cancelled out my $308,249 bet by throwing in a mere
$60,000 (my winnings are less than this because of fees). When
probabilities are close to 0 or 1, as is the case here, the game is
<em>very</em> lopsided in favor of those who are trying to push the
probability away from the extreme value. And this explains not just
Trump; it's also the reason why all sorts of popular-among-a-niche
candidates with no real chance of victory frequently get winning
probabilities as high as 5%.</p>
<h3 id="technical-complexity">Technical complexity</h3>
<p>I had at first tried buying NTRUMP on Augur, but technical glitches
in the user interface prevented me from being able to make orders on
Augur directly (other people I talked to did not have this issue... I am
still not sure what happened there). Catnip's UI is much simpler and
worked excellently. However, automated market makers like Balancer (and
Uniswap) work best for smaller trades; for larger trades, the slippage
is too high. This is a good microcosm of the broader "AMM vs order book"
debate: AMMs are more convenient but order books really do work better
for large trades. Uniswap v3 is introducing an AMM design that has
better capital efficiency; we shall see if that improves things.</p>
<p>There were other technical complexities too, though fortunately they
all seem to be easily solvable. There is no reason why an interface like
Catnip could not integrate the "DAI -&gt; Foundry -&gt; sell YTRUMP"
path into a contract so that you could buy NTRUMP that way in a single
transaction. In fact, the interface could even check the price and
liquidity properties of the "DAI -&gt; NTRUMP" path and the "DAI -&gt;
Foundry -&gt; sell YTRUMP" path and give you the better trade
automatically. Even withdrawing DAI from a MakerDAO CDP can be included
in that path. My conclusion here is optimistic: technical complexity
issues were a real barrier to participation this round, but things will
be much easier in future rounds as technology improves.</p>
<h3 id="intellectual-underconfidence">Intellectual underconfidence</h3>
<p>And now we have the final possibility: that many people (and smart
people in particular) have a pathology that they suffer from excessive
humility, and too easily conclude that if no one else has taken some
action, then there must therefore be a good reason why that action is
not worth taking.</p>
<p>Eliezer Yudkowsky spends the second half of his excellent book <a
href="https://equilibriabook.com/">Inadequate Equilibria</a> making this
case, arguing that too many people overuse "modest epistemology", and we
should be much more willing to act on the results of our reasoning, even
when the result suggests that the great majority of the population is
irrational or lazy or wrong about something. When I read those sections
for the first time, I was unconvinced; it seemed like Eliezer was simply
being overly arrogant. But having gone through this experience, I have
come to see some wisdom in his position.</p>
<p>This was not my first time seeing the virtues of trusting one's own
reasoning first hand. When I had originally started working on Ethereum,
I was at first beset by fear that there must be some very good reason
the project was doomed to fail. A fully programmable
smart-contract-capable blockchain, I reasoned, was clearly such a great
improvement over what came before, that surely many other people must
have thought of it before I did. And so I fully expected that, as soon
as I publish the idea, many very smart cryptographers would tell me the
very good reasons why something like Ethereum was fundamentally
impossible. And yet, no one ever did.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone suffers from excessive modesty. Many of the
people making predictions <em>in favor</em> of Trump winning the
election were arguably fooled by their own excessive contrarianism.
Ethereum benefited from my youthful suppression of my own modesty and
fears, but there are plenty of other projects that could have benefited
from more intellectual humility and avoided failures.</p>

<p>But nevertheless it seems to me more true than ever that, as goes the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Second_Coming_(poem)">famous
Yeats quote</a>, "the best lack all conviction, while the worst are full
of passionate intensity." Whatever the faults of overconfidence or
contrarianism sometimes may be, it seems clear to me that spreading a
society-wide message that the solution is to simply trust the existing
outputs of society, whether those come in the form of academic
institutions, media, governments or markets, is <em>not</em> the
solution. All of these institutions can only work precisely because of
the presence of individuals who think that they do not work, or who at
least think that they can be wrong at least some of the time.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-for-futarchy">Lessons for futarchy</h2>
<p>Seeing the importance of capital costs and their interplay with risks
first hand is also important evidence for judging systems like <a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/08/21/introduction-futarchy/"><strong>futarchy</strong></a>.
Futarchy, and "decision markets" more generally are an important and
potentially very socially useful application of prediction markets.
There is not much social value in having slightly more accurate
predictions of who will be the next president. But there <em>is</em> a
lot of social value in having <strong>conditional predictions</strong>:
<em>if we do A, what's the chance it will lead to some good thing X, and
if we do B instead what are the chances then</em>? Conditional
predictions are important because they do not just satisfy our
curiosity; they can also help us make decisions.</p>
<p>Though electoral prediction markets are much less useful than
conditional predictions, they can help shed light on an important
question: how robust are they to manipulation or even just biased and
wrong opinions? We can answer this question by looking at how difficult
arbitrage is: suppose that a conditional prediction market currently
gives probabilities that (in your opinion) are <em>wrong</em> (could be
because of ill-informed traders or an explicit manipulation attempt; we
don't really care). How much of an impact can you have, and how much
profit can you make, by setting things right?</p>
<p>Let's start with a concrete example. Suppose that we are trying to
use a prediction market to choose between decision A and decision B,
where each decision has some probability of achieving some desirable
outcome. Suppose that <em>your opinion</em> is that decision A has a 50%
chance of achieving the goal, and decision B has a 45% chance. The
market, however, (in your opinion wrongly) thinks decision B has a 55%
chance and decision A has a 40% chance.</p>

<p>Suppose that you are a small participant, so your individual bets
won't affect the outcome; only many bettors acting together could. How
much of your money should you bet?</p>
<p>The standard theory here relies on the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion">Kelly
criterion</a>. Essentially, you should act to maximize the expected
logarithm of your assets. In this case, we can solve the resulting
equation. Suppose you invest portion <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> of your money into buying A-token for
$0.4. Your expected new log-wealth, from your point of view, would
be:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(0.5 * log((1-r) + \frac{r}{0.4}) + 0.5 *
log(1-r)\)</span></p>
<p>The first term is the 50% chance (from your point of view) that the
bet pays off, and the portion <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>
that you invest grows by 2.5x (as you bought dollars at 40 cents). The
second term is the 50% chance that the bet does not pay off, and you
lose the portion you bet. We can use calculus to find the <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> that maximizes this; for the lazy, <a
href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=maximize+0.5+*+log%28%281-r%29+%2B+%5Cfrac%7Br%7D%7B0.4%7D%29+%2B+0.5+*+log%281-r%29">here's
WolframAlpha</a>. The answer is <span class="math inline">\(r =
\frac{1}{6}\)</span>. If other people buy and the price for A on the
market gets up to 47% (and B gets down to 48%), we can redo the
calculation for the last trader who would flip the market over to make
it correctly favor A:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(0.5 * log((1-r) + \frac{r}{0.47}) + 0.5 *
log(1-r)\)</span></p>
<p>Here, the expected-log-wealth-maximizing <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is a mere 0.0566. The conclusion is
clear: when decisions are close and when there is a lot of noise, it
turns out that it only makes sense to invest a small portion of your
money in a market. And this is assuming rationality; most people invest
<em>less</em> into uncertain gambles than the Kelly criterion says they
should. Capital costs stack on top even further. But if an attacker
<em>really</em> wants to force outcome B through because they want it to
happen for personal reasons, they can simply put <em>all</em> of their
capital toward buying that token. All in all, the game can easily be
lopsided more than 20:1 in favor of the attacker.</p>
<p>Of course, in reality attackers are rarely willing to stake all their
funds on one decision. And futarchy is not the only mechanism that is
vulerable to attacks: stock markets are similarly vulnerable, and
non-market decision mechanisms can also be manipulated by determined
wealthy attackers in all sorts of ways. But nevertheless, we should be
wary of assuming that futarchy will propel us to new heights of
decision-making accuracy.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the math seems to suggest that futarchy would
work best when the expected manipulators would want to push the outcome
<em>toward</em> an extreme value. An example of this might be liability
insurance, as someone wishing to improperly obtain insurance would
effectively be trying to force the market-estimated probability that an
unfavorable event will happen down to zero. And as it turns out,
liability insurance is futarchy inventor Robin Hanson's <a
href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/2019/05/yay-liability-insurance.html">new
favorite policy prescription</a>.</p>
<h2 id="can-prediction-markets-become-better">Can prediction markets
become better?</h2>
<p>The final question to ask is: are prediction markets doomed to repeat
errors as grave as giving Trump a 15% chance of overturning the election
in early December, and a 12% chance of overturning it even after the
Supreme Court including three judges whom he appointed telling him to
screw off? Or could the markets improve over time? My answer is,
surprisingly, emphatically on the optimistic side, and I see a few
reasons for optimism.</p>
<h3 id="markets-as-natural-selection">Markets as natural selection</h3>
<p>First, these events have given me a new perspective on how market
efficiency and rationality might actually come about. Too often,
proponents of market efficiency theories claim that market efficiency
results because most participants are rational (or at least the
rationals outweigh any coherent group of deluded people), and this is
true as an axiom. But instead, we could take an <em>evolutionary</em>
perspective on what is going on.</p>
<p>Crypto is a young ecosystem. It is an ecosystem that is still quite
disconnected from the mainstream, Elon's recent tweets notwithstanding,
and that does not yet have much expertise in the minutiae of electoral
politics. Those who <em>are</em> experts in electoral politics have a
hard time getting into crypto, and crypto has a large presence of
not-always-correct forms of contrarianism especially when it comes to
politics. But what happened this year is that within the crypto space,
prediction market users who correctly expected Biden to win got an 18%
increase to their capital, and prediction market users who incorrectly
expected Trump to win got a 100% decrease to their capital (or at least
the portion they put into the bet).</p>
<br>

<p><br></p>
<p>Thus, there is a <em>selection pressure</em> in favor of the type of
people who make bets that turn out to be correct. After ten rounds of
this, good predictors will have more capital to bet with, and bad
predictors will have less capital to bet with. This does <em>not</em>
rely on anyone "getting wiser" or "learning their lesson" or any other
assumption about humans' capacity to reason and learn. It is simply a
result of selection dynamics that over time, participants that are good
at making correct guesses will come to dominate the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Note that prediction markets fare better than stock markets in this
regard: the "nouveau riche" of stock markets often arise from getting
lucky on a single thousandfold gain, adding a lot of noise to the
signal, but in prediction markets, prices are bounded between 0 and 1,
limiting the impact of any one single event.</p>
<h3 id="better-participants-and-better-technology">Better participants
and better technology</h3>
<p>Second, prediction markets themselves will improve. User interfaces
have greatly improved already, and will continue to improve further. The
complexity of the MakerDAO -&gt; Foundry -&gt; Catnip cycle will be
abstracted away into a single transaction. Blockchain scaling technology
will improve, reducing fees for participants (The <a
href="../../../2021/01/05/rollup.html">ZK-rollup</a> <a
href="https://loopring.io/">Loopring</a> with a built-in AMM is already
live on the Ethereum mainnet, and a prediction market could
theoretically run on it).</p>
<p>Third, the demonstration that we saw of the prediction market working
correctly will ease participants' fears. Users will see that the Augur
oracle is capable of giving correct outputs even in very contentious
situations (this time, there were two rounds of disputes, but the no
side nevertheless cleanly won). People from outside the crypto space
will see that the process works and be more inclined to participate.
Perhaps even Nate Silver himself might get some DAI and use Augur, Omen,
Polymarket and other markets to supplement his income in 2022 and
beyond.</p>
<p>Fourth, prediction market tech itself could improve. <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/prediction-market-design-for-betting-on-many-highly-improbable-events/8280">Here
is a proposal from myself</a> on a market design that could make it more
capital-efficient to simultaneously bet against many unlikely events,
helping to prevent unlikely outcomes from getting irrationally high
odds. Other ideas will surely spring up, and I look forward to seeing
more experimentation in this direction.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This whole saga has proven to be an incredibly interesting direct
trial-by-first test of prediction markets and how they collide with the
complexities of individual and social psychology. It shows a lot about
how market efficiency actually works in practice, what are the limits of
it and what could be done to improve it.</p>
<p>It has also been an excellent demonstration of the power of
blockchains; in fact, it is one of the Ethereum applications that have
provided to me the most concrete value. Blockchains are often criticized
for being speculative toys and not doing anything meaningful except for
self-referential games (tokens, with yield farming, whose returns are
powered by... the launch of other tokens). There are certainly exceptions
that the critics fail to recognize; I personally have benefited from ENS
and even from using ETH for payments on several occasions where all
credit card options failed. But over the last few months, it seems like
we have seen a rapid burst in Ethereum applications being concretely
useful for people and interacting with the real world, and prediction
markets are a key example of this.</p>
<p>I expect prediction markets to become an increasingly important
Ethereum application in the years to come. The 2020 election was only
the beginning; I expect more interest in prediction markets going
forward, not just for elections but for conditional predictions,
decision-making and other applications as well. The amazing promises of
what prediction markets could bring if they work mathematically
optimally will, of course, continue to collide with the limits of human
reality, and hopefully, over time, we will get a much clearer view of
exactly where this new social technology can provide the most value.</p>
