<title> Crypto Cities </title>

<p><em>Special thanks to Mr Silly and Tina Zhen for early feedback on
the post, and to a big long list of people for discussion of the
ideas.</em></p>
<p>One interesting trend of the last year has been the growth of
interest in local government, and in the idea of local governments that
have wider variance and do more experimentation. Over the past year,
Miami mayor Francis Suarez has pursued a <a
href="https://twitter.com/francissuarez/status/1335037068108554241">Twitter-heavy</a>
tech-startup-like strategy of attracting interest in the city,
frequently <a
href="https://twitter.com/francissuarez/status/1335037068108554241">engaging</a>
with the mainstream <a
href="https://twitter.com/nedsegal/status/1441431098672644102">tech
industry</a> and <a
href="https://twitter.com/FrancisSuarez/status/1443575122875404294">crypto
community</a> on Twitter. Wyoming now has a <a
href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/crypto-daos-and-the-wyoming-frontier-9251606/">DAO-friendly
legal structure</a>, Colorado is <a
href="https://www.wired.com/story/colorado-quadratic-voting-experiment/">experimenting
with quadratic voting</a>, and we're seeing more and more experiments
making more <a
href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/10/28/20932554/new-york-san-francisco-car-free-zones">pedestrian-friendly
street environments</a> for the offline world. We're even seeing
projects with varying degrees of radicalness - <a
href="https://culdesac.com/">Cul de sac</a>, <a
href="https://cityoftelosa.com/">Telosa</a>, <a
href="https://www.citydao.io/">CityDAO</a>, <a
href="https://nkwashi.com/">Nkwashi</a>, <a
href="https://prospera.hn/">Prospera</a> and many more - trying to
create entire neighborhoods and cities from scratch.</p>
<p>Another interesting trend of the last year has been the rapid
mainstreaming of crypto ideas such as coins, non-fungible tokens and
decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). So what would happen if
we combine the two trends together? Does it make sense to have a city
with a coin, an NFT, a DAO, some record-keeping on-chain for
anti-corruption, or even all four? As it turns out, there are already
people trying to do just that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a
href="https://www.citycoins.co">CityCoins.co</a></strong>, a project
that sets up coins intended to become local media of exchange, where a
portion of the issuance of the coin goes to the city government. <a
href="https://www.citycoins.co/miamicoin">MiamiCoin</a> already exists,
and "San Francisco Coin" appears to be coming soon.</li>
<li>Other experiments with coin issuance (eg. see <a
href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/04/02/south-koreas-capital-is-planning-to-launch-its-own-cryptocurrency">this
project in Seoul</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Experiments with NFTs</strong>, often as a way of funding
local artists. <a
href="https://level19.notion.site/level19/NFT-Busan-2021-The-NFT-Port-of-Asia-95e9274927024a81aa7e716f1bcfbcf0">Busan</a>
is hosting a government-backed conference exploring what they could do
with NFTs.</li>
<li><strong>Reno mayor Hillary Schieve's <a
href="https://thisisreno.com/2021/04/mayor-schieve-wants-to-save-the-space-whale-by-turning-it-into-an-nft/">expansive</a>
vision for <a
href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uqXW0Kt-RzU">blockchainifying</a> the
city</strong>, including <a
href="https://mobile.twitter.com/mayorschieve/status/1367926043563094017?lang=en">NFT
sales</a> to support local art, a RenoDAO with RenoCoins issued to local
residents that could get revenue from the government renting out
properties, blockchain-secured lotteries, blockchain voting and
more.</li>
<li>Much more ambitious projects <strong>creating crypto-oriented cities
from scratch</strong>: see <a
href="https://www.citydao.io/">CityDAO</a>, which describes itself as,
well, "building a city on the Ethereum blockchain" - DAOified governance
and all.</li>
</ul>
<p>But are these projects, in their current form, good ideas? Are there
any changes that could make them into <em>better</em> ideas? Let us find
out...</p>
<h2 id="why-should-we-care-about-cities">Why should we care about
cities?</h2>
<p>Many national governments around the world are showing themselves to
be inefficient and slow-moving in response to long-running problems and
rapid changes in people's underlying needs. In short, many national
governments are missing <a
href="https://medium.com/@samo.burja/live-versus-dead-players-2b24f6e9eae2">live
players</a>. Even worse, many of the outside-the-box political ideas
that <em>are</em> being considered or implemented for national
governance today are honestly quite terrifying. Do <em>you</em> want the
USA to be <a
href="https://amgreatness.com/2021/08/01/the-salazar-option/">taken over
by a clone of WW2-era Portuguese dictator Antonio Salazar</a>, or
perhaps an <a
href="https://americanmind.org/audio/the-stakes-the-american-monarchy/">"American
Caesar"</a>, to beat down the evil scourge of American leftism? For
every idea that can be reasonably described as freedom-expanding or
democratic, there are ten that are just different forms of centralized
control and walls and universal surveillance.</p>
<p>Now consider local governments. <strong>Cities and states, as we've
seen from the examples at the start of this post, are at least in theory
capable of genuine dynamism</strong>. There are large and very real
differences of culture between cities, so it's easier to find a single
city where there is public interest in adopting any particular radical
idea than it is to convince an entire country to accept it. There are
very real challenges and opportunities in local public goods, urban
planning, transportation and many other sectors in the governance of
cities that could be addressed. Cities have tightly cohesive internal
economies where things like widespread cryptocurrency adoption could
realistically independently happen. Furthermore, it's less likely that
experiments within cities will lead to terrible outcomes both because
cities are regulated by higher-level governments and because cities have
an easier escape valve: people who are unhappy with what's going on can
more easily exit.</p>
<p>So all in all, it seems like the local level of government is a very
undervalued one. And given that <a
href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1473095216645631?journalCode=plta">criticism</a>
of existing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_city">smart
city initiatives</a> often heavily focuses on concerns around
centralized governance, lack of transparency and <a
href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/11/google-sidewalk-labs/575551/">data
privacy</a>, blockchain and cryptographic technologies seem like a
promising key ingredient for a more open and participatory way
forward.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-city-projects-up-to-today">What are city projects up to
today?</h2>
<p>Quite a lot actually! Each of these experiments is still small scale
and largely still trying to find its way around, but they are all at
least seeds that could turn into interesting things. Many of the most
advanced projects are in the United States, but there is interest across
the world; over in Korea the government of Busan is <a
href="https://level19.notion.site/level19/NFT-Busan-2021-The-NFT-Port-of-Asia-95e9274927024a81aa7e716f1bcfbcf0">running
an NFT conference</a>. Here are a few examples of what is being done
today.</p>
<h3 id="blockchain-experiments-in-reno">Blockchain experiments in
Reno</h3>
<p>Reno, Nevada mayor <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Schieve">Hillary Schieve</a>
is a blockchain fan, focusing primarily on the Tezos ecosystem, and she
has recently been exploring blockchain-related ideas (see <a
href="https://youtu.be/uqXW0Kt-RzU">her podcast here</a>) in the
governance of her city:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Selling NFTs to fund local art</strong>, starting with an
NFT of <a
href="https://thisisreno.com/2021/04/mayor-schieve-wants-to-save-the-space-whale-by-turning-it-into-an-nft/">the
"Space Whale" sculpture</a> in the middle of the city</li>
<li><strong>Creating a Reno DAO</strong>, governed by Reno coins that
Reno residents would be eligible to receive via an airdrop. The Reno DAO
could start to get sources of revenue; one <a
href="https://youtu.be/uqXW0Kt-RzU?t=904">proposed idea</a> was the city
renting out properties that it owns and the revenue going into a
DAO</li>
<li><strong>Using blockchains to secure all kinds of processes</strong>:
blockchain-secured random number generators for casinos,
blockchain-secured <a
href="../../../2021/05/25/voting2.html">voting</a>, etc.</li>
</ul>
<center>

<p><em>Reno space whale. <a
href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rocor/44153615962">Source
here</a>.</em></p>
</center>
<h3 id="citycoins.co">CityCoins.co</h3>
<p>CityCoins.co is a project built on Stacks, a blockchain run by an
unusual "proof of transfer" (for some reason abbreviated PoX and not
PoT) <a
href="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd72b9f913b35/6154471366c15dae30133499_pox.pdf">block
production algorithm</a> that is built around the Bitcoin blockchain and
ecosystem. 70% of the coin's supply is generated by an ongoing sale
mechanism: anyone with STX (the Stacks native token) can send their STX
to the city coin contract to generate city coins; the STX revenues are
distributed to <em>existing</em> city coin holders who stake their
coins. The remaining 30% is made available to the city government.</p>
<p><strong>CityCoins has made the interesting decision of trying to make
an economic model that does not depend on any government
support</strong>. The local government does not need to be involved in
creating a CityCoins.co coin; a community group can launch a coin by
themselves. An <a
href="https://www.citycoins.co/citycoins-faq">FAQ</a>-provided answer to
"What can I do with CityCoins?" includes examples like "CityCoins
communities will create apps that use tokens for rewards" and "local
businesses can provide discounts or benefits to people who ... stack their
CityCoins". In practice, however, the MiamiCoin community is not going
at it alone; the Miami government has already <a
href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/23/miamicoin-going-mainstream-faster-than-bitcoin-mayor-suarez-says/">de-facto
publicly endorsed it</a>.</p>

hackathon</a> winner: a site that allows coworking spaces to give
preferential offers to MiamiCoin holders.</em></p>
</center>
<h3 id="citydao">CityDAO</h3>
<p>CityDAO is the most radical of the experiments: Unlike Miami and
Reno, which are existing cities with existing infrastructure to be
upgraded and people to be convinced, CityDAO a DAO with legal status
under the Wyoming <a
href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/crypto-daos-and-the-wyoming-frontier-9251606/">DAO
law</a> (see their docs <a
href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Dxf308mA8zXr6ZOinvzgOFcydXV9lzE3ALcVswb70V1Ngaers6_PTDio4UVFxUoh91sm2N_h2QCCSS2JSzaE2ufZRjuLeqQsNyeEMw=s0">here</a>)
trying to create entirely new cities from scratch.</p>
<p>So far, the project is still in its early stages. The team is
currently finalizing <a
href="https://twitter.com/CityDao/status/1442247714729861121">a
purchase</a> of their first plot of land in a <a
href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/44%C2%B055&#39;21.9%22N+109%C2%B015&#39;28.0%22W/@44.9215127,-109.2611115,1702m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d44.92274!4d-109.25779">far-off
corner of Wyoming</a>. The plan is to start with this plot of land, and
then add other plots of land in the future, to build cities, governed by
a DAO and making heavy use of <a
href="https://podofjake.com/2021/09/15/78-scott-fitsimones/">radical
economic ideas like Harberger taxes</a> to allocate the land, make
collective decisions and manage resources. Their DAO is one of the
progressive few that is <a
href="../../../2021/08/16/voting3.html">avoiding coin voting
governance</a>; instead, the governance is a voting scheme based on
"citizen" NFTs, and ideas have been floated to further limit votes to
one-per-person by using <a
href="https://www.proofofhumanity.id/">proof-of-humanity
verification</a>. The NFTs are currently being sold to crowdfund the
project; you can buy them on OpenSea.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-think-cities-could-be-up-to">What do I think cities
could be up to?</h2>
<p>Obviously there are a lot of things that cities could do in
principle. They could add more bike lanes, they could use <a
href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/health/2021-09-11/covid-transmission-co2-carbon-dioxide-monitor-ventilation-school/100444884">CO2
meters</a> and <a
href="https://www.colorado.edu/today/2021/10/04/specific-uv-light-wavelength-could-offer-low-cost-safe-way-curb-covid-19-spread">far-UVC
light</a> to more effectively reduce COVID spread without
inconveniencing people, and they could even fund life extension
research. But my primary specialty is blockchains and this post is about
blockchains, so... let's focus on blockchains.</p>
<p>I would argue that there are two distinct categories of blockchain
ideas that make sense:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Using blockchains to create <strong>more trusted, transparent and
verifiable versions of existing processes</strong>.</li>
<li>Using blockchains to implement <strong>new and experimental forms of
ownership</strong> for land and other scarce assets, as well as
<strong>new and experimental forms of democratic
governance</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>There's a natural fit between blockchains and both of these
categories. Anything happening on a blockchain is very easy to publicly
verify, with lots of ready-made freely available tools to help people do
that. Any application built on a blockchain can immediately plug in to
and interface with other applications in the entire global blockchain
ecosystem. Blockchain-based systems are efficient in a way that paper is
not, and publicly verifiable in a way that centralized computing systems
are not - a necessary combination if you want to, say, make a new form
of voting that allows citizens to give high-volume real-time feedback on
hundreds or thousands of different issues.</p>
<p>So let's get into the specifics.</p>
<h3
id="what-are-some-existing-processes-that-blockchains-could-make-more-trusted-and-transparent">What
are some existing processes that blockchains could make more trusted and
transparent?</h3>
<p>One simple idea that plenty of people, including government officials
around the world, have brought up to me on many occasions is the idea of
governments creating a whitelisted internal-use-only stablecoin for
tracking internal government payments. Every tax payment from an
individual or organization could be tied to a publicly visible on-chain
record minting that number of coins (if we want individual tax payment
quantities to be private, there are <a
href="../../../2021/01/26/snarks.html">zero-knowledge ways</a> to make
only the total public but still convince everyone that it was computed
correctly). Transfers between departments could be done "in the clear",
and the coins would be redeemed only by individual contractors or
employees claiming their payments and salaries.</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/cities/govcoin.png"
class="padded" /></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>This system could easily be extended. For example, procurement
processes for choosing which bidder wins a government contract could
largely be done on-chain.</p>
<p>Many more processes could be made more trustworthy with
blockchains:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fair random number generators (eg. for lotteries)</strong> -
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-77V1IareQ">VDFs</a>, such as
the one Ethereum is expected to include, could serve as a fair random
number generator that could be used to make government-run lotteries
more trustworthy. Fair randomness could also be used for many other use
cases, such as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition">sortition</a> as a form
of government.</li>
<li><strong>Certificates</strong>, for example cryptographic proofs that
some particular individual is a resident of the city, could be done
on-chain for added verifiability and security (eg. if such certificates
are issued on-chain, it would become obvious if a large number of false
certificates are issued). This can be used by all kinds of
local-government-issued certificates.</li>
<li><strong>Asset registries</strong>, for land and other assets, as
well as more complicated forms of property ownership such as development
rights. Due to the need for courts to be able to make assignments in
exceptional situations, these registries will likely never be fully
decentralized bearer instruments in the same way that cryptocurrencies
are, but putting records on-chain can still make it easier to see what
happened in what order in a dispute.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually, even <strong>voting</strong> could be done on-chain.
Here, <a href="../../../2021/05/25/voting2.html">many complexities and
dragons loom</a> and it's really important to be careful; a
sophisticated solution combining blockchains, zero knowledge proofs and
other cryptography is needed to achieve all the desired privacy and
security properties. However, if humanity is ever going to move to
electronic voting at all, local government seems like the perfect place
to start.</p>
<h2
id="what-are-some-radical-economic-and-governance-experiments-that-could-be-interesting">What
are some radical economic and governance experiments that could be
interesting?</h2>
<p>But in addition to these kinds of blockchain overlays onto things
that governments <em>already</em> do, we can also look at blockchains as
an opportunity for governments to make completely <em>new</em> and
radical experiments in economics and governance. These are not
necessarily final ideas on what I think should be done; they are more
initial explorations and suggestions for possible directions. Once an
experiment starts, real-world feedback is often by far the most useful
variable to determine how the experiment should be adjusted in the
future.</p>
<h3
id="experiment-1-a-more-comprehensive-vision-of-city-tokens">Experiment
#1: a more comprehensive vision of city tokens</h3>
<p>CityCoins.co is one vision for how city tokens could work. But it is
far from the only vision. Indeed, the CityCoins.so approach has
significant risks, particularly in how economic model is heavily tilted
toward early adopters. 70% of the STX revenue from minting new coins is
given to <em>existing stakers of the city coin</em>. More coins <a
href="https://docs.citycoins.co/citycoins-core-protocol/issuance-schedule">will
be issued</a> in the next five years than in the fifty years that
follow. It's a good deal for the government in 2021, but what about
2051? Once a government endorses a particular city coin, it becomes
difficult for it to change directions in the future. Hence, it's
important for city governments to think carefully about these issues,
and choose a path that makes sense for the long term.</p>
<p><strong>Here is a different possible sketch of a narrative of how
city tokens might work.</strong> It's far from the <em>only</em>
possible alternative to the CityCoins.co vision; see Steve Waldman's <a
href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7513.html">excellent article</a>
arguing for a city-localized medium of exchange for yet another possible
direction. In any case, city tokens are a wide design space, and there
are many different options worth considering. Anyway, here goes...</p>
<hr />
<p>The concept of home ownership in its current form is a notable
double-edged sword, and the specific ways in which it's actively
encouraged and legally structured is considered by many to be <a
href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/01/16/home-ownership-is-the-wests-biggest-economic-policy-mistake">one
of the biggest economic policy mistakes</a> that we are making today.
<strong>There is an inevitable political tension between a home as a
place to live and a home as an investment asset</strong>, and the
pressure to satisfy communities who care about the latter often ends up
severely harming the affordability of the former. A resident in a city
either owns a home, making them massively over-exposed to land prices
and introducing perverse incentives to fight against construction of new
homes, or they rent a home, making them <em>negatively</em> exposed to
the real estate market and thus putting them economically at odds with
the goal of making a city a nice place to live.</p>
<p>But even despite all of these problems, many still find home
ownership to be not just a good personal choice, but something worthy of
actively subsidizing or socially encouraging. One big reason is that it
nudges people to save money and build up their net worth. Another big
reason is that despite its flaws, it creates economic alignment between
residents and the communities they live in. <strong>But what if we could
give people a way to save and create that economic alignment without the
flaws?</strong> What if we could create a divisible and fungible city
token, that residents could hold as many units of as they can afford or
feel comfortable with, and whose value goes up as the city prospers?</p>
<p>First, let's start with some possible objectives. Not all are
necessary; a token that accomplishes only three of the five is already a
big step forward. But we'll try to hit as many of them as possible:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get sustainable sources of revenue for the
government</strong>. The city token economic model should avoid
redirecting <em>existing</em> tax revenue; instead, it should find
<em>new</em> sources of revenue.</li>
<li><strong>Create economic alignment between residents and the
city</strong>. This means first of all that the coin itself should
clearly become more valuable as the city becomes more attractive. But it
also means that the economics should actively encourage
<em>residents</em> to hold the coin more than faraway hedge funds.</li>
<li><strong>Promote saving and wealth-building</strong>. Home ownership
does this: as home owners make mortgage payments, they build up their
net worth by default. City tokens could do this too, making it
attractive to accumulate coins over time, and even gamifying the
experience.</li>
<li><strong>Encourage more pro-social activity</strong>, such as
positive actions that help the city and more sustainable use of
resources.</li>
<li><strong>Be egalitarian</strong>. Don't unduly favor wealthy people
over poor people (as badly designed economic mechanisms often do
accidentally). A token's divisibility, avoiding a sharp binary divide
between haves and have-nots, does a lot already, but we can go further,
eg. by allocating a large portion of new issuance to residents as a
UBI.</li>
</ul>
<p>One pattern that seems to easily meet the first three objectives is
providing benefits to holders: if you hold at least X coins (where X can
go up over time), you get some set of services for free. MiamiCoin is
trying to encourage businesses to do this, but we could go further and
make <em>government</em> services work this way too. One simple example
would be making existing public parking spaces only available for free
to those who hold at least some number of coins in a locked-up form.
This would serve a few goals at the same time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an <strong>incentive to hold the coin</strong>, sustaining
its value.</li>
<li>Create an <strong>incentive specifically for <em>residents</em> to
hold the coin</strong>, as opposed to otherwise-unaligned faraway
investors. Furthermore, the incentive's usefulness is capped per-person,
so it encourages widely distributed holdings.</li>
<li>Creates <strong>economic alignment</strong> (city becomes more
attractive -&gt; more people want to park -&gt; coins have more value).
<strong>Unlike home ownership, this creates alignment with an <em>entire
town</em></strong>, and not merely a very specific location in a
town.</li>
<li><strong>Encourage sustainable use of resources</strong>: it would
reduce usage of parking spots (though people without coins who really
need them could still pay), supporting many local governments' desires
to open up more space on the roads to be more pedestrian-friendly.
Alternatively, restaurants could also be allowed to lock up coins
through the same mechanism and claim parking spaces to use for outdoor
seating.</li>
</ul>
<p>But to avoid perverse incentives, it's extremely important to avoid
overly depending on one specific idea and instead to have a diverse
array of possible revenue sources. <strong>One excellent gold mine of
places to give city tokens value, and at the same time experiment with
novel governance ideas, is zoning</strong>. If you hold at least Y
coins, then you can quadratically vote on the fee that nearby landowners
have to pay to bypass zoning restrictions. This hybrid market + direct
democracy based approach would be much more efficient than current
overly cumbersome permitting processes, and the fee itself would be
another source of government revenue. More generally, any of the ideas
in the next section could be combined with city tokens to give city
token holders more places to use them.</p>

#2: more radical and participatory forms of governance</h3>
<p>This is where <a
href="../../../2018/04/20/radical_markets.html">Radical Markets</a>
ideas such as Harberger taxes, <a
href="../../../2019/12/07/quadratic.html">quadratic voting and quadratic
funding</a> come in. I already brought up some of these ideas in the
section above, but you don't have to have a dedicated city token to do
them. Some limited government use of quadratic voting and funding has
already happened: see the <a
href="https://www.wired.com/story/colorado-quadratic-voting-experiment/">Colorado
Democratic party</a> and the <a
href="https://presidential-hackathon.taiwan.gov.tw/2020/en/">Taiwanese
presidential hackathon</a>, as well as not-yet-government-backed
experiments like Gitcoin's <a
href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210304144119/https://downtownstimulus.com/">Boulder
Downtown Stimulus</a>. But we could do more!</p>
<p>One obvious place where these ideas can have long-term value is
giving developers incentives to improve the <strong>aesthetics of
buildings</strong> that they are building (see <a
href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-10-05/urban-design-why-can-t-we-build-nice-neighborhoods-anymore">here</a>,
<a

<a

and <a
href="https://twitter.com/noahpinion/status/1287084300542676992?lang=en">here</a>
for some recent examples of professional blabbers debating the
aesthetics of modern architecture). Harberger taxes and other mechanisms
could be used to radically reform <strong>zoning</strong> rules, and
blockchains could be used to administer such mechanisms in a more
trustworthy and efficient way. Another idea that is more viable in the
short term is <strong>subsidizing local businesses</strong>, similar to
the Downtown Stimulus but on a larger and more permanent scale.
Businesses produce various kinds of positive externalities in their
local communities all the time, and those externalities could be more
effectively rewarded. <strong>Local news</strong> could be quadratically
funded, revitalizing a long-struggling industry. Pricing for
<strong>advertisements</strong> could be set based on real-time votes of
how much people enjoy looking at each particular ad, encouraging more
originality and creativity.</p>
<p>More democratic feedback (and possibly even <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rb904_OJj0">retroactive</a>
democratic feedback!) could plausibly create better incentives in all of
these areas. And <strong>21st-century digital democracy through
real-time online quadratic voting and funding could plausibly do a much
better job than 20th-century democracy, which seems in practice to have
been largely characterized by rigid building codes and obstruction at
planning and permitting hearings</strong>. And of course, if you're
going to use blockchains to secure voting, starting off by doing it with
fancy new kinds of votes seems far more safe and politically feasible
than re-fitting existing voting systems.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>There are a lot of worthwhile ideas for cities to experiment with
that could be attempted by existing cities or by new cities. New cities
of course have the advantage of not having existing residents with
existing expectations of how things should be done; but the concept of
creating a new city itself is, in modern times, relatively untested.
Perhaps the multi-billion-dollar capital pools in the hands of people
and projects enthusiastic to try new things could get us over the hump.
But even then, existing cities will likely continue to be the place
where most people live for the foreseeable future, and existing cities
can use these ideas too.</p>
<p><strong>Blockchains can be very useful in both the more incremental
and more radical ideas that were proposed here, even despite the
inherently "trusted" nature of a city government.</strong> Running any
new or existing mechanism on-chain gives the public an easy ability to
verify that everything is following the rules. Public chains are better:
the benefits from existing infrastructure for users to independently
verify what is going on far outweigh the losses from transaction fees,
which are expected to quickly decrease very soon from <a
href="../../../2021/01/05/rollup.html">rollups</a> and <a
href="../../../2021/04/07/sharding.html">sharding</a>. If strong privacy
is required, blockchains can be combined <a
href="../../../2021/01/26/snarks.html">zero knowledge cryptography</a>
to give privacy and security at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>The main trap that governments should avoid is too quickly
sacrificing optionality</strong>. An <em>existing</em> city could fall
into this trap by launching a bad city token instead of taking things
more slowly and launching a good one. A <em>new</em> city could fall
into this trap by selling off too much land, sacrificing the entire
upside to a small group of early adopters. Starting with self-contained
experiments, and taking things slowly on moves that are truly
irreversible, is ideal. But at the same time, it's also important to
seize the opportunity in the first place. There's a lot that can and
should be improved with cities, and a lot of opportunities; despite the
challenges, crypto cities broadly are an idea whose time has come.</p>
