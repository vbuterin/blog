<title> Blockchain voting is overrated among uninformed people but underrated among informed people </title>

<p><em>Special thanks to Karl Floersch, Albert Ni, Mr Silly and others
for feedback and discussion</em></p>
<p>Voting is a procedure that has a very important need for process
integrity. The result of the vote must be correct, and this must be
guaranteed by a transparent process so that everyone can be convinced
that the result is correct. It should not be possible to successfully <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_suppression">interfere with
anyone's attempt to vote</a> or prevent their vote from being
counted.</p>
<p>Blockchains are a technology which is all about providing guarantees
about process integrity. If a process is run on a blockchain, the
process is guaranteed to run according to some pre-agreed code and
provide the correct output. No one can prevent the execution, no one can
tamper with the execution, and no one can censor and block any users'
inputs from being processed.</p>
<p>So at first glance, it seems that blockchains provide exactly what
voting needs. And I'm far from the only person to have had that thought;
<a

users <a

interested</a>. But as it turns out, some people have a very different
opinion....</p>

</center>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>Despite the seeming perfect match between the needs of voting and the
technological benefits that blockchains provide, we regularly see scary
articles <a
href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3430697/why-blockchain-could-be-a-threat-to-democracy.html">arguing
against the combination</a> of the two. And it's not just a single
article: <a
href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-blockchains-the-answer-for-secure-elections-probably-not/">here's
an anti-blockchain-voting piece from Scientific American</a>, here's <a
href="https://www.cnet.com/news/blockchain-isnt-answer-to-voting-system-woes/">another
from CNet</a>, and here's <a
href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/11/blockchain-based-elections-would-be-a-disaster-for-democracy/">another
from ArsTechnica</a>. And it's not just random tech journalists: <a
href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2020/11/on-blockchain-voting.html">Bruce
Schneier</a> is against blockchain voting, and researchers at MIT <a
href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/PSNR20.pdf">wrote a whole
paper</a> arguing that it's a bad idea. So what's going on?</p>
<h2 id="outline">Outline</h2>
<p>There are <strong>two key lines of criticism</strong> that are most
commonly levied by critics of blockchain voting protocols:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Blockchains are the wrong software tool</strong> to run an
election. The trust properties they provide are not a good match for the
properties that voting needs, and other kinds of software tools with
different information flow and trust properties would work better.</li>
<li><strong>Software in general cannot be trusted</strong> to run
elections, no matter what software it is. The risk of undetectable
software and hardware bugs is too high, no matter how the platform is
organized.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>This article will discuss both of these claims in turn
("refute" is too strong a word, but I definitely disagree more than I
agree with both claims)</strong>. First, I will discuss the security
issues with existing attempts to use blockchains for voting, and how
<strong>the correct solution is not to abandon blockchains, but to
combine them with other cryptographic technologies</strong>. Second, I
will address the concern about whether or not software (and hardware)
can be trusted. The answer: <strong>computer security is actually
getting quite a bit better</strong>, and we can work hard to continue
that trend.</p>
<p>Over the long term, <strong>insisting on paper permanently would be a
<em>huge</em> handicap to our ability to make voting better</strong>.
One vote per N years is a 250-year-old form of democracy, and we can
have much better democracy if voting were much more convenient and
simpler, so that we could do it much more often.</p>
<p><strong>Needless to say, this entire post is predicated on good
blockchain scaling technology (eg. <a
href="../../../2021/04/07/sharding.html">sharding</a>) being
available.</strong> Of course, if blockchains cannot scale, none of this
can happen. But so far, development of this technology is proceeding
quickly, and there's no reason to believe that it can't happen.</p>
<h2 id="bad-blockchain-voting-protocols">Bad blockchain voting
protocols</h2>
<p>Blockchain voting protocols get hacked all the time. Two years ago, a
blockchain voting tech company called Voatz was all the rage, and many
people were very excited about it. But last year, some MIT researchers
discovered a <a
href="https://internetpolicy.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SecurityAnalysisOfVoatz_Public.pdf">string
of critical security vulnerabilities</a> in their platform. Meanwhile,
in Moscow, a blockchain voting system that was going to be used for an
upcoming election <a
href="https://medium.com/swlh/why-was-moscows-blockchain-voting-system-cracked-a-month-before-an-election-6da5e6d9abbb">was
hacked</a>, fortunately a month before the election took place.</p>
<p>The hacks were pretty serious. Here is a table of the attack
capabilities that <a
href="https://internetpolicy.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SecurityAnalysisOfVoatz_Public.pdf">researchers
analyzing Voatz</a> managed to uncover:</p>

<p><br><br></p>
<p>This by itself is not an argument against <em>ever</em> using
blockchain voting. But it is an argument that blockchain voting software
should be designed more carefully, and scaled up slowly and
incrementally over time.</p>
<h2 id="privacy-and-coercion-resistance">Privacy and coercion
resistance</h2>
<p>But even the blockchain voting protocols that are not technically
broken often suck. To understand why, we need to delve deeper into
<em>what specific security properties</em> blockchains provide, and what
specific security properties voting needs - when we do, we'll see that
there is a mismatch.</p>
<p>Blockchains provide two key properties: <strong>correct
execution</strong> and <strong>censorship resistance</strong>. Correct
execution just means that the blockchain accepts inputs ("transactions")
from users, correctly processes them according to some pre-defined
rules, and returns the correct output (or adjusts the blockchain's
"state" in the correct way). Censorship resistance is also simple to
understand: any user that <em>wants</em> to send a transaction, and is
willing to pay a high enough fee, <em>can</em> send the transaction and
expect to see it quickly included on-chain.</p>
<p>Both of these properties are very important for voting: you want the
output of the vote to actually be the result of counting up the number
of votes for each candidate and selecting the candidate with the most
votes, and you definitely want anyone who is eligible to vote to be able
to vote, even if some powerful actor is trying to block them.
<strong>But voting also requires some crucial properties that
blockchains <em>do not</em> provide</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong>: you should not be able to tell which
candidate someone specific voted for, or even if they voted at all</li>
<li><strong>Coercion resistance</strong>: you should not be able to
<em>prove</em> to someone else how you voted, <em>even if you want
to</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The need for the first requirement is obvious: you want people to
vote based on their personal feelings, and not how people around them or
their employer or the police or random thugs on the street will feel
about their choice. The second requirement is needed to prevent vote
selling: if you can prove how you voted, selling your vote becomes very
easy. Provability of votes would also enable forms of coercion where the
coercer demands to see some kind of proof of voting for their preferred
candidate. Most people, even those aware of the first requirement, do
not think about the second requirement. But the second requirement is
also necessary, and it's quite technically nontrivial to provide it.
<strong>Needless to say, the average "blockchain voting system" that you
see in the wild does not even try to provide the second property, and
usually fails at providing the first</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="secure-electronic-voting-without-blockchains">Secure electronic
voting without blockchains</h2>
<p>The concept of cryptographically secured execution of social
mechanisms was not invented by blockchain geeks, and indeed existed far
before us. Outside the blockchain space, there is a 20-year-old
tradition of cryptographers working on the secure electronic voting
problem, and the good news is that there <em>have</em> been solutions.
An important paper that is cited by much of the literature of the last
two decades is Juels, Catalano and Jakobsson's 2002 paper titled "<a
href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2002/165.pdf">Coercion-Resistant
Electronic Elections</a>":</p>
<center>
<br>
<img src="../../../../images/voting2-files/elections.png" style="width:650px" class="padded" />
<br><br><br>
</center>
<p>Since then, there have been many iterations on the concept; <a
href="https://orbilu.uni.lu/bitstream/10993/29212/1/Civitas-VFinal.pdf">Civitas</a>
is one prominent example, though there are <a
href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/jets15/jets_0302-achenbach.pdf">also</a>
<a
href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221947496_Coercion-Resistant_Cryptographic_Voting_Implementing_Free_and_Secret_Electronic_Elections">many</a>
<a
href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-32747-6_5">others</a>.
These protocols all use a similar set of core techniques. There is an
agreed-upon set of "talliers" and there is a trust assumption that the
majority of the talliers is honest. The talliers each have "shares" of a
private key secret-shared among themselves, and the corresponding public
key is published. Voters publish votes encrypted to the talliers' public
key, and talliers use a <a
href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/pragmaticmpc/pragmaticmpc.pdf">secure
multi-party computation (MPC) protocol</a> to decrypt and verify the
votes and compute the tally. The tallying computation is done "inside
the MPC": the talliers never learn their private key, and they compute
the final result without learning anything about any individual vote
beyond what can be learned from looking at the final result itself.</p>
<p>Encrypting votes provides privacy, and some additional infrastructure
such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mix_network">mix-nets</a>
is added on top to make the privacy stronger. To provide coercion
resistance, one of two techniques is used. One option is that during the
registration phase (the phase in which the talliers learn each
registered voter's public key), the voter generates or receives a secret
key. The corresponding public key is secret shared among the talliers,
and the talliers' MPC only counts a vote if it is signed with the secret
key. A voter has no way to prove to a third party what their secret key
is, so if they are bribed or coerced they can simply show and cast a
vote signed with the wrong secret key. Alternatively, a voter could have
the ability to send a message to <em>change</em> their secret key. A
voter has no way of proving to a third party that they did <em>not</em>
send such a message, leading to the same result.</p>
<p>The second option is a technique where voters can make multiple votes
where the second overrides the first. If a voter is bribed or coerced,
they can make a vote for the briber/coercer's preferred candidate, but
later send another vote to override the first.</p>
<center>
<br>
<img src="../../../../images/voting2-files/tallyingscheme.png" style="width:650px" class="padded" />
<br><br> <small><i>Giving voters the ability to make a later vote that
can override an earlier vote is the key coercion-resistance mechanism of
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/jets15/jets_0302-achenbach.pdf">this
protocol from 2015.</a></i></small><br><br>
</center>
<p>Now, we get to a key important nuance in all of these protocols. They
all rely on an outside primitive to complete their security guarantees:
the <strong>bulletin board</strong> (this is the "BB" in the figure
above). The bulletin board is a place where any voter can send a
message, with a guarantee that (i) anyone can read the bulletin board,
and (ii) anyone can send a message to the bulletin board that gets
accepted. Most of the coercion-resistant voting papers that you can find
will casually reference the existence of a bulletin board (<a
href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/jets15/jets_0302-achenbach.pdf">eg.</a>
"as is common for electronic voting schemes, we assume a publicly
accessible append-only bulletin board"), but far fewer papers talk about
how this bulletin board can actually be <em>implemented</em>. And here,
you can hopefully see where I am going with this: <strong>the most
secure way to implement a bulletin board <em>is</em> to just use an
existing blockchain!</strong></p>
<h2 id="secure-electronic-voting-with-blockchains">Secure electronic
voting with blockchains</h2>
<p>Of course, there have been plenty of pre-blockchain attempts at
making a bulletin board. <a
href="https://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/107392/5/append-only.pdf">This paper
from 2008</a> is such an attempt; its trust model is a standard
requirement that "<code>k</code> of <code>n</code> servers must be
honest" (<code>k = n/2</code> is common). <a
href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/047.pdf">This literature review from
2021</a> covers some pre-blockchain attempts at bulletin boards as well
as exploring the use of blockchains for the job; the pre-blockchain
solutions reviewed similarly rely on a k-of-n trust model.</p>
<p>A blockchain is also a k-of-n trust model; it requires at least half
of miners or proof of stake validators to be following the protocol, and
if that assumption fails that often results in a "51% attack". So why is
a blockchain better than a special purpose bulletin board? The answer
is: setting up a k-of-n system that's actually trusted is hard, and
blockchains are the only system that has already solved it, and at
scale. Suppose that some government announced that it was making a
voting system, and provided a list of 15 local organizations and
universities that would be running a special-purpose bulletin board. How
would you, as an outside observer, know that the government didn't just
choose those 15 organizations from a list of 1000 based on their
willingness to secretly collude with an intelligence agency?</p>
<p><strong>Public blockchains, on the other hand, have permissionless
economic consensus mechanisms (proof of work or proof of stake) that
anyone can participate in, and they have an existing diverse and highly
incentivized infrastructure of block explorers, exchanges and other
watching nodes to constantly verify in real time that nothing bad is
going on.</strong></p>
<p>These more sophisticated voting systems are not <em>just</em> using
blockchains; they rely on cryptography such as <a
href="../../../2021/01/26/snarks.html">zero knowledge proofs</a> to
guarantee correctness, and on multi-party computation to guarantee
coercion resistance. Hence, they avoid the weaknesses of more naive
systems that simply just "put votes directly on the blockchain" and
ignore the resulting privacy and coercion resistance issues. However,
the blockchain bulletin board is nevertheless a key part of the security
model of the whole design: if the committee is broken but the blockchain
is not, coercion resistance is lost but all the other guarantees around
the voting process still remain.</p>
<h3 id="maci-coercion-resistant-blockchain-voting-in-ethereum">MACI:
coercion-resistant blockchain voting in Ethereum</h3>
<p>The Ethereum ecosystem is currently experimenting with a <a
href="https://github.com/appliedZKP/maci">system called MACI</a> that
combines together a blockchain, ZK-SNARKs and a single central actor
that guarantees coercion resistance (but has no power to compromise any
properties other than coercion resistance). MACI is not very technically
difficult. Users participate by signing a message with their private
key, encrypting the signed message to a public key published by a
central server, and publishing the encrypted signed message to the
blockchain. The server downloads the messages from the blockchain,
decrypts them, processes them, and outputs the result along with a
ZK-SNARK to ensure that they did the computation correctly.</p>
<br>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/round9/maci2.png" style="width:500px" class="padded" />
</center>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>Users cannot prove how they participated, because they have the
ability to send a "key change" message to trick anyone trying to audit
them: they can first send a key change message to change their key from
A to B, and then send a "fake message" signed with A. The server would
reject the message, but no one else would have any way of knowing that
the key change message had ever been sent. There is a trust requirement
on the server, though only for privacy and coercion resistance; the
server cannot publish an incorrect result either by computing
incorrectly or by censoring messages. In the long term, multi-party
computation can be used to decentralize the server somewhat,
strengthening the privacy and coercion resistance guarantees.</p>
<p>There is a working demo of this scheme at <a
href="https://clr.fund/">clr.fund</a> being used for quadratic funding.
The use of the Ethereum blockchain to ensure censorship resistance of
votes ensures a much higher degree of censorship resistance than would
be possible if a committee was relied on for this instead.</p>
<h3 id="recap">Recap</h3>
<ul>
<li>The voting process has four important security requirements that
must be met for a vote to be secure: <strong>correctness</strong>,
<strong>censorship resistance</strong>, <strong>privacy</strong> and
<strong>coercion resistance</strong>.</li>
<li>Blockchains are good at the first two. They are bad at the last
two.</li>
<li><strong>Encryption</strong> of votes put on a blockchain can add
privacy. <strong>Zero knowledge proofs</strong> can bring back
correctness despite observers being unable to add up votes directly
because they are encrypted.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-party computation</strong> decrypting and checking
votes can provide coercion resistance, if combined with a mechanic where
users can interact with the system multiple times; either the first
interaction invalidates the second, or vice versa</li>
<li>Using a blockchain ensures that you have very high-security
censorship resistance, and you keep this censorship resistance <em>even
if</em> the committee colludes and breaks coercion resistance.
<strong>Introducing a blockchain can significantly increase the level of
security of the system.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="but-can-technology-be-trusted">But can technology be
trusted?</h2>
<p>But now we get back to the second, deeper, critique of electronic
voting of any kind, blockchain or not: that technology itself is too
insecure to be trusted.</p>
<p>The <a
href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/PSNR20.pdf">recent MIT
paper</a> criticizing blockchain voting includes this helpful table,
depicting <em>any</em> form of paperless voting as being fundamentally
too difficult to secure:</p>
<br>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/voting2-files/fourcategories.png" style="width:650px" class="padded" />
</center>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>The key property that the authors focus on is
<strong>software-independence</strong>, which they define as "the
property that an undetected change or error in a system's software
cannot cause an undetectable change in the election outcome". Basically,
a bug in the code should not be able to accidentally make Prezzy
McPresidentface the new president of the country (or, more
realistically, a deliberately inserted bug should not be able to
increase some candidate's share from 42% to 52%).</p>
<p>But there are other ways to deal with bugs. For example, any
blockchain-based voting system that uses publicly verifiable
zero-knowledge proofs can be independently verified. Someone can write
their own implementation of the proof verifier and verify the Zk-SNARK
themselves. They could even write their own software to vote. Of course,
the technical complexity of actually doing this is beyond 99.99% of any
realistic voter base, but if thousands of independent experts have the
ability to do this and verify that it works, that is more than good
enough in practice.</p>
<p>To the MIT authors, however, that is not enough:</p>
<br>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 35px; margin-right: 35px">
<p>Thus, any system that is electronic only, even if end-to-end
verifiable, seems unsuitable for political elections in the foreseeable
future. The U.S. Vote Foundation has noted the promise of E2E-V methods
for improving online voting security, but has issued a detailed report
recommending avoiding their use for online voting unless and until the
technology is far more mature and fully tested in pollsite voting
[38].</p>
<p>Others have proposed extensions of these ideas. For example, the
proposal of Juels et al. [55] emphasizes the use of cryptography to
provide a number of forms of "coercion resistance." The Civitas proposal
of Clarkson et al. [24] implements additional mechanisms for coercion
resistance, which Iovino et al. [53] further incorporate and elaborate
into their Selene system. From our perspective, these proposals are
innovative but unrealistic: they are quite complex, and most seriously,
their security relies upon voters' devices being uncompromised and
functioning as intended, an unrealistic assumption.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<p>The problem that the authors focus on is not the <em>voting system's
hardware</em> being secure; risks on that side actually can be mitigated
with zero knowledge proofs. Rather, the authors focus on a different
security problem: can <em>users' devices</em> even in principle be made
secure?</p>
<p>Given the long history of all kinds of exploits and hacks of consumer
devices, one would be very justified in thinking the answer is "no".
Quoting my own <a
href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-self-defense-part-i-wallet-protection-1368758841">article
on Bitcoin wallet security from 2013</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last night around 9PM PDT, I clicked a link to go to
CoinChat[.]freetzi[.]com – and I was prompted to run java. I did
(thinking this was a legitimate chatoom), and nothing happened. I closed
the window and thought nothing of it. I opened my bitcoin-qt wallet
approx 14 minutes later, and saw a transaction that I did NOT approve go
to wallet 1Es3QVvKN1qA2p6me7jLCVMZpQXVXWPNTC for almost my entire
wallet...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In June 2011, the Bitcointalk member "allinvain" lost 25,000 BTC
(worth $500,000 at the time) after an unknown intruder somehow gained
direct access to his computer. The attacker was able to access
allinvain's wallet.dat file, and quickly empty out the wallet – either
by sending a transaction from allinvain's computer itself, or by simply

<p>But these disasters obscure a greater truth: <strong><em>over the
past twenty years, computer security has actually been <a
href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/opinions/cybersecurity-getting-better-worse/">slowly
and steadily improving</a></em></strong>. Attacks are much harder to
find, often requiring the attacker to find bugs in multiple sub-systems
instead of finding a single hole in a large complex piece of code.
High-profile incidents are larger than ever, but this is not a sign that
anything is getting less secure; rather, it's simply a sign that we are
becoming much more dependent on the internet.</p>
<p><strong><a
href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-0-387-39940-9_1491">Trusted
hardware</a></strong> is a very important recent source of improvements.
Some of the new "blockchain phones" (eg. <a
href="https://www.htcexodus.com/mea-en/cryptophone/exodus1s/">this one
from HTC</a>) go quite far with this technology and put a minimalistic
security-focused operating system on the trusted hardware chip, allowing
high-security-demanding applications (eg. cryptocurrency wallets) to
stay separate from the other applications. Samsung has started making
phones using <a
href="https://pixelplex.io/blog/what-is-samsung-blockchain-keystore/">similar</a>
<a
href="https://www.samsung.com/us/business/solutions/samsung-knox/">technology</a>.
And even devices that are never advertised as "blockchain devices" (eg.
iPhones) frequently have trusted hardware of some kind. Cryptocurrency
hardware wallets are effectively the same thing, except the trusted
hardware module is physically located outside the computer instead of
inside it. Trusted hardware (deservedly!) often gets a bad rap in
security circles and especially the blockchain community, because it
just <a
href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/03/hackers-can-steal-secret-data-stored-in-intels-sgx-secure-enclave/">keeps</a>
getting <a
href="https://techmonitor.ai/techonology/cybersecurity/intel-sgx-plundervolt-attack">broken</a>
again and <a
href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/11/14/intel_sgx_physical_security/">again</a>.
And indeed, you definitely don't want to use it to <em>replace</em> your
security protection. But as an <em>augmentation</em>, it's a huge
improvement.</p>
<p>Finally, single applications, like cryptocurrency wallets and voting
systems, are much simpler and have less room for error than an entire
consumer operating system - even if you have to incorporate support for
<a href="../../../2019/12/07/quadratic.html">quadratic voting</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition">sortition</a>, <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/quadratic-voting-with-sortition/6065">quadratic
sortition</a> and whatever horrors the next generation's Glen Weyl
invents in 2040. The benefit of tools like trusted hardware is their
ability to <em>isolate</em> the simple thing from the complex and
possibly broken thing, and these tools are having some success.</p>
<h2
id="so-the-risks-might-decrease-over-time.-but-what-are-the-benefits">So
the risks might decrease over time. But what are the benefits?</h2>
<p>These improvements in security technology point to a future where
consumer hardware might be more trusted in the future than it is today.
Investments made in this area in the last few years are likely to keep
paying off over the next decade, and we could expect further significant
improvements. But what are the benefits of making voting electronic
(blockchain based or otherwise) that justify exploring this whole
space?</p>
<p><strong>My answer is simple: voting would become much more efficient,
allowing us to do it much more often</strong>. Currently, formal
democratic input into organizations (governmental <em>or</em> corporate)
tends to be limited to a single vote once every 1-6 years. This
effectively means that each voter is only putting less than one bit of
input into the system each year. Perhaps in large part as a result of
this, decentralized decision-making in our society is heavily bifurcated
into two extremes: pure democracy and pure markets. Democracy is either
very inefficient (corporate and government votes) or very insecure
(social media likes/retweets). Markets are far more technologically
efficient and are much more secure than social media, but their
fundamental economic logic makes them a poor fit for many kinds of
decision problems, particularly having to do with public goods.</p>

<i><small>Yes, I know it's yet another triangle, and I really really
apologize for having to use it. But please bear with me just this once....
(ok fine, I'm sure I'll make even more triangles in the future; just
suck it up and deal with it)</small></i>
</center>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>There is a lot that we could do if we could build more systems that
are somewhere in between democracy and markets, benefiting from the
egalitarianism of the former, the technical efficiency of the latter and
economic properties all along the spectrum in between the two extremes.
<a href="../../../2019/12/07/quadratic.html">Quadratic funding</a> is an
excellent example of this. Liquid democracy is another excellent
example. Even if we don't introduce fancy new delegation mechanisms or
quadratic math, there's a lot that we could do by doing voting <em>much
more</em> and at smaller scales more adapted to the information
available to each individual voter. But the challenge with all of these
ideas is that in order to have a scheme that durably maintains
<em>any</em> level of democraticness at all, you need some form of sybil
resistance and vote-buying mitigation: exactly the problems that these
fancy ZK-SNARK + MPC + blockchain voting schemes are trying to
solve.</p>
<h2 id="the-crypto-space-can-help">The crypto space can help</h2>
<p>One of the underrated benefits of the crypto space is that it's an
excellent "virtual special economic zone" for testing out economic and
cryptographic ideas in a highly adversarial environment. Whatever you
build and release, once the economic power that it controls gets above a
certain size, a whole host of diverse, sometimes altruistic, sometimes
profit-motivated, and sometimes malicious actors, many of whom are
completely anonymous, will descend upon the system and try to twist that
economic power toward their own various objectives.</p>
<p>The incentives for attackers are high: if an attacker steals $100
from your cryptoeconomic gadget, they can often get the full $100 in
reward, and they can often get away with it. But the incentives for
defenders are also high: if you develop a tool that helps users
<em>not</em> lose their funds, you could (at least sometimes) turn that
into a tool and earn millions. Crypto is the ultimate training zone: if
you can build something that can survive in this environment at scale,
it can probably also survive in the bigger world as well.</p>
<p>This applies to <a href="../../../2021/04/02/round9.html">quadratic
funding</a>, it applies to <a
href="https://gnosis-safe.io/">multisig</a> and <a
href="../../../2021/01/11/recovery.html">social recovery wallets</a>,
and it can apply to voting systems too. The blockchain space has already
helped to motivate the rise of important security technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware wallets</li>
<li>Efficient general-purpose zero knowledge proofs</li>
<li>Formal verification tools</li>
<li>"Blockchain phones" with trusted hardware chips</li>
<li>Anti-sybil schemes like <a
href="https://www.proofofhumanity.id/">Proof of Humanity</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In all of these cases, some version of the technology existed before
blockchains came onto the scene. But it's hard to deny that blockchains
have had a significant impact in pushing these efforts forward, and the
large role of incentives inherent to the space plays a key role in
raising the stakes enough for the development of the tech to actually
happen.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p><strong>In the short term, any form of blockchain voting should
certainly remain confined to small experiments</strong>, whether in
small trials for more mainstream applications or for the blockchain
space itself. Security is at present definitely not good enough to rely
on computers for everything. But it's improving, and if I am wrong and
security <em>fails</em> to improve then not only blockchain voting, but
also cryptocurrency as a whole, will have a hard time being successful.
Hence, there is a large incentive for the technology to continue to
improve.</p>
<p>We should all continue watching the technology and the efforts being
made everywhere to try and increase security, and slowly become more
comfortable using technology in very important social processes.
Technology is <em>already</em> key in our financial markets, and a
crypto-ization of a large part of the economy (or even just replacing
gold) will put an even greater portion of the economy into the hands of
our cryptographic algorithms and the hardware that is running them. We
should watch and support this process carefully, and over time take
advantage of its benefits to bring our governance technologies into the
21st century.</p>
