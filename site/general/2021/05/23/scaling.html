<title> The Limits to Blockchain Scalability </title>

<p><em>Special thanks to Felix Lange, Martin Swende, Marius van der
Wijden and Mark Tyneway for feedback and review.</em></p>
<p>Just how far can you push the scalability of a blockchain? Can you
really, as <a
href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1393738154889338884">Elon Musk
wishes</a>, "speed up block time 10X, increase block size 10X &amp; drop
fee 100X" without leading to extreme centralization and compromising the
fundamental properties that make a blockchain what it is? If not, how
far can you go? What if you change the consensus algorithm? Even more
importantly, what if you change the technology to introduce features
such as ZK-SNARKs or sharding? A sharded blockchain can theoretically
just keep adding more shards; is there such a thing as adding too
many?</p>
<p>As it turns out, there are important and quite subtle technical
factors that limit blockchain scaling, both with sharding and without.
In many cases there are solutions, but even with the solutions there are
limits. This post will go through what many of these issues are.</p>

<h2
id="its-crucial-for-blockchain-decentralization-for-regular-users-to-be-able-to-run-a-node">It's
crucial for blockchain decentralization for regular users to be able to
run a node</h2>
<p>At 2:35 AM, you receive an emergency call from your partner on the
opposite side of the world who helps run your mining pool (or it could
be a staking pool). Since about 14 minutes ago, your partner tells you,
your pool and a few others split off from the chain which still carries
79% of the network. According to your node, the majority chain's blocks
are invalid. There's a balance error: the key block appeared to
erroneously assign 4.5 million extra coins to an unknown address.</p>
<p>An hour later, you're in a telegram chat with the other two small
pools who were caught blindsided just as you were, as well as some block
explorers and exchanges. You finally see someone paste a link to a
tweet, containing a published message. "Announcing new on-chain
sustainable protocol development fund", the tweet begins.</p>
<p>By the morning, arguments on Twitter, and on the one community forum
that was not censoring the discussion, discussions are everywhere. But
by then a significant part of the 4.5 million coins had been converted
on-chain to other assets, and billions of dollars of defi transactions
had taken place. 79% of the consensus nodes, and all the major block
explorers and endpoints for light wallets, were following this new
chain. Perhaps the new dev fund will fund some development, or perhaps
it will just all be embezzled by the leading pools and exchanges and
their cronies. But regardless of how it turns out, the fund is for all
intents and purposes a fait accompli, and regular users have no way to
fight back.</p>

<small><i>Movie coming soon. Maybe it can be funded by MolochDAO or
something.</i></small>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Can this happen on your blockchain? The elites of your blockchain
community, including pools, block explorers and hosted nodes, are
probably quite well-coordinated; quite likely they're all in the same
telegram channels and wechat groups. If they really <em>want</em> to
organize a sudden change to the protocol rules to further their own
interests, then they probably can. The Ethereum blockchain has fully
resolved <a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/11/25/security-alert-11242016-consensus-bug-geth-v1-4-19-v1-5-2/">consensus
failures</a> in ten hours; if your blockchain has only one client
implementation, and you only need to deploy a code change to a few dozen
nodes, coordinating a change to client code can be done much faster. The
only reliable way to make this kind of coordinated social attack
<em>not</em> effective is through passive defense from the one
constituency that actually is decentralized: the <em>users</em>.</p>
<p>Imagine how the story would have played out if the users were running
nodes that verify the chain (whether directly or through <a
href="../../../2021/04/07/sharding.html#improving-sharding-with-better-security-models">more
advanced indirect techniques</a>), and automatically reject blocks that
break the protocol rules <em>even if</em> over 90% of the miners or
stakers support those blocks. If <em>every</em> user ran a verifying
node, then the attack would have quickly failed: a few mining pools and
exchanges would have forked off and looked quite foolish in the process.
But even if <em>some</em> users ran verifying nodes, the attack would
not have led to a <em>clean victory</em> for the attacker; rather, it
would have led to <em>chaos</em>, with different users seeing different
views of the chain. At the very least, the ensuing market panic and
likely persistent chain split would greatly reduce the attackers'
profits. The thought of navigating such a protracted conflict would
itself deter most attacks.</p>

<small><i>Listen to Hasu on this one.</i></small>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>If you have a community of 37 node runners and 80000 passive
listeners that check signatures and block headers, the attacker wins. If
you have a community where everyone runs a node, the attacker loses. We
don't know what the exact threshold is at which <a
href="../../../2020/08/17/philosophy.html">herd immunity</a> against
coordinated attacks kicks in, but there is one thing that's absolutely
clear: more nodes good, fewer nodes bad, and we definitely need more
than a few dozen or few hundred.</p>
<h2
id="so-what-are-the-limits-to-how-much-work-we-can-require-full-nodes-to-do">So,
what are the limits to how much work we can require full nodes to
do?</h2>
<p>To maximize the number of users who can run a node, we'll focus on
regular consumer hardware. There are some increases to capacity that can
be achieved by demanding some specialized hardware purchases that are
easy to obtain (eg. from Amazon), but they actually don't increase
scalability by that much.</p>
<p>There are three key limitations to a full node's ability to process a
large number of transactions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Computing power</strong>: what % of the CPU can we safely
demand to run a node?</li>
<li><strong>Bandwidth</strong>: given the realities of current internet
connections, how many <em>bytes</em> can a block contain?</li>
<li><strong>Storage</strong>: how many gigabytes on disk can we require
users to store? Also, how quickly must it be readable? (ie. is HDD okay
or do we need SSD)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Many erroneous takes on how far a blockchain can scale using
"simple" techniques stem from overly optimistic estimates for each of
these numbers</strong>. We can go through these three factors one by
one:</p>
<h3 id="computing-power">Computing power</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bad answer</strong>: 100% of CPU power can be spent on block
verification</li>
<li><strong>Correct answer</strong>: ~5-10% of CPU power can be spent on
block verification</li>
</ul>
<p>There are four key reasons why the limit is so low:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need a safety margin to cover the possibility of DoS attacks
(transactions crafted by an attacker to take advantage of weaknesses in
code to take longer to process than regular transactions)</li>
<li>Nodes need to be able to sync the chain after being offline. If I
drop off the network for a minute, I should be able to catch up in a few
seconds</li>
<li>Running a node should not drain your battery very quickly and make
all your other apps very slow</li>
<li>There are other non-block-production tasks that nodes need to do as
well, mostly around verifying and responding to incoming transactions
and requests on the p2p network</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that up until recently, most explanations for "why only 5-10%?"
focused on a different problem: that because PoW blocks come at random
times, it taking a long time to verify blocks increases the risk that
multiple blocks get created at the same time. There are many fixes to
this problem (eg. <a
href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi16/nsdi16-paper-eyal.pdf">Bitcoin
NG</a>, or just using proof of stake). But these fixes do NOT solve the
other four problems, and so they don't enable large gains in scalability
as many had initially thought.</p>
<p>Parallelism is also not a magic bullet. Often, even clients of
seemingly single-threaded blockchains are parallelized already:
signatures can be verified by one thread while execution is done by
other threads, and there's a separate thread that's handling transaction
pool logic in the background. And the closer you get to 100% usage
across <em>all</em> threads, the more energy-draining running a node
becomes and the lower your safety margin against DoS.</p>
<h3 id="bandwidth">Bandwidth</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bad answer</strong>: if we have 10 MB blocks every 2-3
seconds, then most users have a &gt;10 MB/sec network, so of course they
can handle it</li>
<li><strong>Correct answer</strong>: <em>maybe</em> we can handle 1-5 MB
blocks every 12 seconds. It's hard though.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nowadays we frequently hear very high advertised statistics for how
much bandwidth internet connections can offer: numbers of 100 Mbps and
even 1 Gbps are common to hear. However, there is a large difference
between advertised bandwidth and the expected actual bandwidth of a
connection for several reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>"Mbps" refers to "millions of <em>bits</em> per second"; a bit is
1/8 of a byte, so you need to divide advertised bit numbers by 8 to get
the advertised byte numbers.</li>
<li>Internet providers, just like all companies, often lie.</li>
<li>There's always multiple applications using the same internet
connection, so a node can't hog the entire bandwidth.</li>
<li>p2p networks inevitably introduce their own overhead: nodes often
end up downloading and re-uploading the same block multiple times (not
to mention transactions being broadcasted through the mempool
<em>before</em> being included in a block).</li>
</ol>
<p>When Starkware did an experiment in 2019 where they published 500 kB
blocks after the <a
href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2028">transaction data gas cost
decrease</a> made that possible for the first time, a few nodes were
actually unable to handle blocks of that size. Ability to handle large
blocks has since been improved and will continue to be improved. But no
matter what we do, we'll still be <em>very</em> far from being able to
naively take the average bandwidth in MB/sec, convince ourselves that
we're okay with 1s latency, and be able to have blocks that are that
size.</p>
<h3 id="storage">Storage</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bad answer</strong>: 10 terabytes</li>
<li><strong>Correct answer</strong>: 512 gigabytes</li>
</ul>
<p>The main argument here is, as you might guess, the same as elsewhere:
the difference between theory and practice. <em>In theory</em>, there
are <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-870-QVO-SATA-MZ-77Q8T0B/dp/B089C3TZL9/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=8tb&amp;qid=1621637865&amp;s=pc&amp;sr=1-3">8
TB solid state drives</a> that you can buy on Amazon (you <em>do</em>
need SSDs or NVME; HDDs are too slow for storing the blockchain state).
<em>In practice</em>, the laptop that was used to write this blog post
has 512 GB, and if you make people go buy their own hardware, many of
them will just get lazy (or they can't afford $800 for an 8 TB SSD) and
use a centralized provider. And even if you can fit a blockchain onto
some storage, a high level of activity can easily quickly burn through
the disk and force you to keep getting a new one.</p>
<br>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/scaling-files/poll.png" /><br><br>
<small><i>A poll in a group of blockchain protocol researchers of how
much disk space everyone has. Small sample size, I know, but
still...</i></small>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Additionally, storage size determines the time needed for a new node
to be able to come online and start participating in the network. Any
data that existing nodes have to store is data that a new node has to
download. This initial sync time (and bandwidth) is also a major barrier
to users being able to run nodes. While writing this blog post, syncing
a new geth node took me ~15 hours. If Ethereum had 10x more usage,
syncing a new geth node would take at least a week, and it would be much
more likely to just lead to your internet connection getting throttled.
This is all even more important during an attack, when a successful
response to the attack will likely involve many users spinning up new
nodes when they were not running nodes before.</p>
<h3 id="interaction-effects">Interaction effects</h3>
<p>Additionally, there are interaction effects between these three types
of costs. Because databases use tree structures internally to store and
retrieve data, the cost of fetching data from a database increases with
the logarithm of the size of the database. In fact, because the top
level (or top few levels) can be cached in RAM, the disk access cost is
proportional to the <em>size of the database as a multiple of the size
of the data cached in RAM</em>.</p>
<br>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/scaling-files/tree.png" class="padded" /><br><br>
<small><i>Don't take this diagram too literally; different databases
work in different ways, and often the part in memory is just a single
(but big) layer (see
<a href="http://paperhub.s3.amazonaws.com/18e91eb4db2114a06ea614f0384f2784.pdf">LSM
trees</a> as used in leveldb). But the basic principles are the
same.</i></small>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>For example, if the cache is 4 GB, and we assume that each layer of
the database is 4x bigger than the previous, then Ethereum's current ~64
GB state would require ~2 accesses. But if the state size increases by
4x to ~256 GB, then this would increase to ~3 accesses (so 1.5x more
accesses per read). Hence, a 4x increase in the gas limit, which would
increase both the state size and the number of reads, could actually
translate into a ~6x increase in block verification time. The effect may
be even stronger: hard disks often take longer to read and write when
they are full than when they are near-empty.</p>
<h3 id="so-what-does-this-mean-for-ethereum">So what does this mean for
Ethereum?</h3>
<p>Today in the Ethereum blockchain, running a node already is
challenging for many users, though it is still at least
<em>possible</em> on regular hardware (I just synced a node on my laptop
while writing this post!). Hence, we are close to hitting bottlenecks.
<strong>The issue that core developers are most concerned with is
storage size.</strong> Thus, at present, valiant efforts at solving
bottlenecks in computation and data, and even changes to the consensus
algorithm, are unlikely to lead to large gas limit increases being
accepted. Even <a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/05/18/eth-state-problems/">solving
Ethereum's largest outstanding DoS vulnerability</a> only led to a gas
limit increase of 20%.</p>
<p>The only solution to storage size problems is <a
href="https://hackmd.io/@vbuterin/state_expiry_paths">statelessness and
state expiry</a>. <strong>Statelessness</strong> allows for a class of
nodes that verify the chain <em>without</em> maintaining permanent
storage. <strong>State expiry</strong> pushes out state that has not
been recently accessed, forcing users to manually provide proofs to
renew it. Both of these paths have been worked at for a long time, and
proof-of-concept implementation on statelessness has already started.
These two improvements combined can greatly alleviate these concerns and
open up room for a significant gas limit increase. <strong>But even
after statelessness and state expiry are implemented, gas limits may
only increase safely by perhaps ~3x until the other limitations start to
dominate.</strong></p>
<p>Another possible medium-term solution is using ZK-SNARKs to verify
transactions. ZK-SNARKs would ensure that regular users do not have to
personally store the state <em>or</em> verify blocks, though they still
would need to download all the data in blocks to protect against <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/research/wiki/A-note-on-data-availability-and-erasure-coding">data
unavailability attacks</a>. Additionally, even if attackers cannot force
<em>invalid</em> blocks through, if capacity is increased to the point
where running a consensus node is <em>too</em> difficult, there is still
the risk of coordinated censorship attacks. Hence, ZK-SNARKs cannot
increase capacity infinitely, but they still can increase capacity by a
significant margin (perhaps 1-2 orders of magnitude). Some chains are
exploring this approach at layer 1; Ethereum is getting the benefits of
this approach through layer-2 protocols (called <a
href="../../../2021/01/05/rollup.html">ZK rollups</a>) such as <a
href="https://zksync.io/">zksync</a>, <a
href="https://loopring.org/">Loopring</a> and <a
href="https://medium.com/starkware/on-the-road-to-starknet-a-permissionless-stark-powered-l2-zk-rollup-83be53640880">Starknet</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-after-sharding">What happens after sharding?</h2>
<p><strong>Sharding fundamentally gets around the above limitations,
because it decouples the data contained on a blockchain from the data
that a single node needs to process and store.</strong> Instead of nodes
verifying blocks by personally downloading and executing them, they use
<a href="../../../2021/04/07/sharding.html">advanced mathematical and
cryptographic techniques</a> to verify blocks indirectly.</p>
<p>As a result, sharded blockchains can safely have very high levels of
transaction throughput that non-sharded blockchains cannot. This does
require a lot of cryptographic cleverness in creating efficient
substitutes for naive full validation that successfully reject invalid
blocks, but it can be done: the <a
href="https://hackmd.io/@vbuterin/das">theory</a> is <a
href="../../../2021/01/26/snarks.html">well-established</a> and
proof-of-concepts based on <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/sharding/beacon-chain.md">draft
specifications</a> are already <a
href="https://github.com/protolambda/eth2-das">being worked on</a>.</p>
<br>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/sharding-files/beacon_chain.jpg" class="padded" /><br>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ethereum is planning to use <strong>quadratic sharding</strong>,
where total scalability is limited by the fact that a node has to be
able to process both a single shard and the beacon chain which has to
perform some fixed amount of management work for each shard. If shards
are too big, nodes can no longer process individual shards, and if there
are too many shards, nodes can no longer process the beacon chain. The
product of these two constraints forms the upper bound.</p>
<p>Conceivably, one could go further by doing cubic sharding, or even
exponential sharding. Data availability sampling would certainly become
much more complex in such a design, but it can be done. But Ethereum is
not going further than quadratic. The reason is that the extra
scalability gains that you get by going from shards-of-transactions to
shards-of-shards-of-transactions actually cannot be realized without
other risks becoming unacceptably high.</p>
<p>So what are these risks?</p>
<h3 id="minimum-user-count">Minimum user count</h3>
<p>A non-sharded blockchain can conceivably run as long as there is even
one user that cares to participate in it. Sharded blockchains are not
like this: no single node can process the whole chain, and so you need
enough nodes so that they can at least process the chain
<em>together</em>. If each node can process 50 TPS, and the chain can
process 10000 TPS, then the chain needs at least 200 nodes to survive.
If the chain at any point gets to less than 200 nodes, then either nodes
stop being able to keep up with the chain, or nodes stop being able to
detect invalid blocks, or a number of other bad things may happen,
depending on how the node software is set up.</p>
<p>In practice, the safe minimum count is several times higher than the
naive "chain TPS divided by node TPS" heuristic due to the need for
redundancy (including for <a href="https://hackmd.io/@vbuterin/das">data
availability sampling</a>); for our above example, let's call it 1000
nodes.</p>
<p>If a sharded blockchain's capacity increases by 10x, the minimum user
count also increases by 10x. Now, you might ask: why don't we start with
a little bit of capacity, and increase it only when we see lots of users
so we actually need it, and decrease it if the user count goes back
down?</p>
<p>There are a few problems with this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A blockchain itself cannot reliably detect how many unique users are
on it, and so this would require some kind of governance to detect and
set the shard count. Governance over capacity limits <a
href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_size_limit_controversy">can
easily become a locus of division and conflict</a>.</li>
<li>What if many users suddenly and unexpectedly drop out at the same
time?</li>
<li>Increasing the minimum number of users needed for a fork to start
makes it harder to defend against hostile takeovers.</li>
</ol>
<p>A minimum user count of under 1,000 is almost certainly fine. A
minimum user count of 1 million, on the other hand, is certainly not.
Even a minimum user count of 10,000 is arguably starting to get risky.
<strong>Hence, it seems difficult to justify a sharded blockchain having
more than a few hundred shards</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="history-retrievability">History retrievability</h3>
<p>An important property of a blockchain that users really value is
<strong>permanence</strong>. A digital asset stored on a server will
stop existing in 10 years when the company goes bankrupt or loses
interest in maintaining that ecosystem. An NFT on Ethereum, on the other
hand, <em>is forever</em>.</p>
<br>
<center>
<img src="../../../../images/scaling-files/cryptokitties.png" /><br><br>
<small><i>Yes, people will still be downloading and examining your
cryptokitties in the year 2371. Deal with it.</i></small>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>But once a blockchain's capacity gets too high, it becomes harder to
store all that data, until at some point there's a large risk that some
part of history will just end up being stored by... nobody.</p>
<p>Quantifying this risk is easy. Take the blockchain's data capacity in
MB/sec, and multiply by ~30 to get the amount of data stored in
terabytes per year. The current sharding plan has a data capacity of
~1.3 MB/sec, so about 40 TB/year. If that is increased by 10x, this
becomes 400 TB/year. If we want the data to be not just accessible, but
accessible <em>conveniently</em>, we would also need metadata (eg.
decompressing rollup transactions), so make that 4 petabytes per year,
or 40 petabytes after a decade. The Internet Archive uses <a
href="https://archive.org/web/petabox.php">50 petabytes</a>. So that's a
reasonable upper bound for how large a sharded blockchain can safely
get.</p>
<p>Hence, it looks like on both of these dimensions, <strong>the
Ethereum sharding design is actually already roughly targeted fairly
close to reasonable maximum safe values</strong>. The constants can be
increased <em>a little bit</em>, but not too much.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>There are two ways to try to scale a blockchain: <strong>fundamental
technical improvements</strong>, and simply <strong>increasing the
parameters</strong>. Increasing the parameters sounds very attractive at
first: if you do the math on a napkin, it is easy to convince yourself
that a consumer laptop can process thousands of transactions per second,
no ZK-SNARKs or rollups or sharding required. Unfortunately, there are
many subtle reasons why this approach is fundamentally flawed.</p>
<p>Computers running blockchain nodes cannot spend 100% of CPU power
validating the chain; they need a large safety margin to resist
unexpected DoS attacks, they need spare capacity for tasks like
processing transactions in the mempool, and you don't want running a
node on a computer to make that computer unusable for <em>any</em> other
applications at the same time. Bandwidth similarly has overhead: a 10
MB/s connection does NOT mean you can have a 10 megabyte block every
second! A 1-5 megabyte block every 12 seconds, <em>maybe</em>. And it is
the same with storage. Increasing hardware requirements for running a
node and limiting node-running to specialized actors is <em>not</em> a
solution. <strong>For a blockchain to be decentralized, it's crucially
important for regular users to be able to run a node, and to have a
culture where running nodes is a common activity</strong>.</p>
<p>Fundamental technical improvements, on the other hand, <em>can</em>
work. Currently, <strong>the main bottleneck in Ethereum is storage
size, and statelessness and state expiry can fix this</strong> and allow
an increase of perhaps up to ~3x - but not more, as we want running a
node to become <em>easier</em> than it is today. <strong>Sharded
blockchains can scale much further</strong>, because no single node in a
sharded blockchain needs to process <em>every</em> transaction. But even
there, there are limits to capacity: as capacity goes up, the minimum
safe user count goes up, and the cost of archiving the chain (and the
risk that data is lost if no one bothers to archive the chain) goes up.
But we don't have to worry too much: those limits are high enough that
we can probably process over a million transactions per second with the
full security of a blockchain. But it's going to take work to do this
without sacrificing the decentralization that makes blockchains so
valuable.</p>
