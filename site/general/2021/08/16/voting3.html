<p>One of the important trends in the blockchain space over the past
year is the transition from focusing on <strong>decentralized finance
(DeFi)</strong> to also thinking about <strong>decentralized governance
(DeGov)</strong>. While the 2020 is <a
href="https://consensys.net/blog/news/2019-was-the-year-of-defi-and-why-2020-will-be-too/">often</a>
widely, and with much justification, <a
href="https://harrisonglobal.capital/2020/08/21/2020-has-been-the-year-of-defi-heres-how-it-has-given-cryptocurrencies-a-new-lease-of-life/">hailed</a>
as <a href="https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/2020-the-year-of-defi">a
year of DeFi</a>, over the year since then the growing complexity and
capability of DeFi projects that make up this trend has led to growing
interest in decentralized governance to handle that complexity. There
are examples inside of Ethereum: <a
href="https://gov.yearn.finance/">YFI</a>, <a
href="https://medium.com/compound-finance/compound-governance-5531f524cf68">Compound</a>,
<a
href="https://blog.synthetix.io/transition-to-decentralised-governance/">Synthetix</a>,
<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/uniswap-token">UNI</a>, <a
href="https://gitcoin.co/blog/introducing-gtc-gitcoins-governance-token/">Gitcoin</a>
and others have all launched, or even <em>started with</em>, some kind
of DAO. But it's also true outside of Ethereum, with arguments over <a
href="https://medium.com/@jiangzhuoer/infrastructure-funding-plan-for-bitcoin-cash-131fdcd2412e">infrastructure</a>
<a
href="https://medium.com/bitcoin-abc/ifp-questions-and-answers-94b76dae2503">funding</a>
<a
href="https://www.bitcoinabc.org/2020-02-15-miner-fund/">proposals</a>
in Bitcoin Cash, <a
href="https://news.bitcoin.com/zcash-to-distribute-20-of-mining-rewards/">infrastructure
funding votes in Zcash</a>, and much more.</p>
<p>The rising popularity of formalized decentralized governance of some
form is undeniable, and there are important reasons why people are
interested in it. But it is also important to keep in mind the risks of
such schemes, as the recent <a
href="https://decrypt.co/38050/steem-steemit-tron-justin-sun-cryptocurrency-war">hostile
takeover of Steem</a> and subsequent mass exodus to Hive makes clear. I
would further argue that these trends are unavoidable.
<strong>Decentralized governance in some contexts is both necessary and
dangerous</strong>, for reasons that I will get into in this post. How
can we get the benefits of DeGov while minimizing the risks? I will
argue for one key part of the answer: <strong>we need to move beyond
coin voting as it exists in its present form</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="degov-is-necessary">DeGov is necessary</h2>
<p>Ever since the <a
href="https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence">Declaration of
Independence of Cyberspace</a> in 1996, there has been a key unresolved
contradiction in what can be called cypherpunk ideology. On the one
hand, cypherpunk values are all about using cryptography to minimize
coercion, and maximize the efficiency and reach of the main non-coercive
coordination mechanism available at the time: private property and
markets. On the other hand, the economic logic of private property and
markets is optimized for activities that <a
href="../../../2019/12/07/quadratic.html#private-goods-private-markets">can
be "decomposed"</a> into repeated one-to-one interactions, and the
infosphere, where art, documentation, science and code are produced and
consumed through irreducibly one-to-many interactions, is the exact
opposite of that.</p>
<p>There are two key problems inherent to such an environment that need
to be solved:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Funding public goods</strong>: how do projects that are
valuable to a wide and unselective group of people in the community, but
which often do not have a business model (eg. layer-1 and layer-2
protocol research, client development, documentation...), get funded?</li>
<li><strong>Protocol maintenance and upgrades</strong>: how are upgrades
to the protocol, and regular maintenance and adjustment operations on
parts of the protocol that are not long-term stable (eg. lists of safe
assets, price oracle sources, multi-party computation keyholders),
agreed upon?</li>
</ul>
<p>Early blockchain projects largely ignored both of these challenges,
pretending that the only public good that mattered was network security,
which could be achieved with a single algorithm set in stone forever and
paid for with fixed proof of work rewards. This state of affairs in
funding was possible at first because of extreme Bitcoin price rises
from 2010-13, then the one-time ICO boom from 2014-17, and again from
the simultaneous second crypto bubble of 2014-17, all of which made the
ecosystem wealthy enough to temporarily paper over the large market
inefficiencies. Long-term governance of public resources was similarly
ignored: Bitcoin took the path of extreme minimization, focusing on
providing a fixed-supply currency and ensuring support for layer-2
payment systems like Lightning and nothing else, Ethereum continued
developing mostly harmoniously (with <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)">one major
exception</a>) because of the strong <a
href="../../../2021/03/23/legitimacy.html">legitimacy</a> of its
pre-existing roadmap (basically: "proof of stake and sharding"), and
sophisticated application-layer projects that required anything more did
not yet exist.</p>
<p>But now, increasingly, that luck is running out, and challenges of
coordinating protocol maintenance and upgrades and funding
documentation, research and development while avoiding the risks of
centralization are at the forefront.</p>
<h3 id="the-need-for-degov-for-funding-public-goods">The need for DeGov
for funding public goods</h3>
<p>It is worth stepping back and seeing the absurdity of the present
situation. Daily mining issuance rewards from Ethereum are about 13500
ETH, or about $40m, <a href="https://etherscan.io/chart/blockreward">per
day</a>. <a href="https://etherscan.io/chart/transactionfee">Transaction
fees</a> are similarly high; the <a
href="https://etherscan.io/chart/transactionfee">non-EIP-1559-burned
portion</a> continues to be around 1,500 ETH (~$4.5m) per day. So there
are many billions of dollars per year going to fund network security.
Now, what is the budget of the Ethereum Foundation? About $30-60 million
per year. There are non-EF actors (eg. Consensys) contributing to
development, but they are not much larger. The situation in Bitcoin is
similar, with perhaps even less funding going into non-security public
goods.</p>
<p>Here is the situation in a chart:</p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/legitimacy-files/chart.png"
class="padded" /></p>
<p>Within the Ethereum ecosystem, one can make a case that this
disparity does not matter too much; tens of millions of dollars per year
is "enough" to do the needed R&amp;D and adding more funds <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month">does not
necessarily improve things</a>, and so the risks to the platform's <a
href="https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/">credible neutrality</a>
from instituting in-protocol developer funding exceed the benefits. But
in many smaller ecosystems, both ecosystems within Ethereum and entirely
separate blockchains like BCH and Zcash, the same debate is brewing, and
at those smaller scales the imbalance makes a big difference.</p>
<p>Enter DAOs. A project that launches as a "pure" DAO from day 1 can
achieve a combination of two properties that were previously impossible
to combine: (i) sufficiency of developer funding, and (ii) credible
neutrality of funding (the much-coveted "fair launch"). Instead of
developer funding coming from a hardcoded list of receiving addresses,
the decisions can be made by the DAO itself.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/voting3-files/issuance_types.png"
class="padded" /></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Of course, it's difficult to make a launch perfectly fair, and
unfairness from information asymmetry can often be worse than unfairness
from explicit premines (was Bitcoin <em>really</em> a fair launch
considering how few people had a chance to even hear about it by the
time 1/4 of the supply had already been handed out by the end of 2010?).
But even still, in-protocol compensation for non-security public goods
from day one seems like a potentially significant step forward toward
getting sufficient and more credibly neutral developer funding.</p>
<h3 id="the-need-for-degov-for-protocol-maintenance-and-upgrades">The
need for DeGov for protocol maintenance and upgrades</h3>
<p>In addition to public goods funding, the other equally important
problem requiring governance is protocol maintenance and upgrades. While
I advocate trying to minimize all non-automated parameter adjustment
(see the <a href="#solution-1-limited-governance">"limited governance"
section below</a>) and I am a fan of <a
href="https://docs.reflexer.finance/ungovernance/governance-minimization-guide">RAI's
"un-governance" strategy</a>, there are times where governance is
unavoidable. Price oracle inputs must come from somewhere, and
occasionally that somewhere needs to change. Until a protocol "ossifies"
into its final form, improvements have to be coordinated somehow.
Sometimes, a protocol's community might <em>think</em> that they are
ready to ossify, but then the world throws a curveball that requires a
complete and controversial restructuring. What happens if the US dollar
collapses, and RAI has to scramble to create and maintain their own
decentralized CPI index for their stablecoin to remain stable and
relevant? Here too, DeGov is necessary, and so avoiding it outright is
not a viable solution.</p>
<p>One important distinction is whether or not <em>off-chain</em>
governance is possible. I have for a long time been <a
href="../../../2017/12/17/voting.html">a fan of off-chain governance</a>
wherever possible. And indeed, for base-layer blockchains, off-chain
governance absolutely <em>is</em> possible. <strong>But for
application-layer projects, and especially defi projects, we run into
the problem that application-layer smart contract systems often
<em>directly control external assets</em>, and that control cannot be
forked away.</strong> If Tezos's on-chain governance gets captured by an
attacker, the community can hard-fork away without any losses beyond
(admittedly high) coordination costs. If MakerDAO's on-chain governance
gets captured by an attacker, the community can absolutely spin up a new
MakerDAO, but they will lose all the ETH and other assets that are stuck
in the existing MakerDAO CDPs. <strong>Hence, while off-chain governance
is a good solution for base layers and <em>some</em> application-layer
projects, many application-layer projects, particularly DeFi, will
inevitably require formalized on-chain governance of some
form.</strong></p>
<h2 id="degov-is-dangerous">DeGov is dangerous</h2>
<p>However, all current instantiations of decentralized governance come
with great risks. To followers of my writing, this discussion will not
be new; the risks are much the same as those that I talked about <a
href="../../../2017/12/17/voting.html">here</a>, <a
href="../../../2018/03/28/plutocracy.html">here</a> and <a
href="../../../2019/04/03/collusion.html">here</a>. There are two
primary types of issues with coin voting that I worry about: <strong>(i)
inequalities and incentive misalignments even in the absence of
attackers, and (ii) outright attacks through various forms of (often
obfuscated) vote buying.</strong> To the former, there have already been
many proposed mitigations (eg. delegation), and there will be more. But
the latter is a much more dangerous elephant in the room to which I see
no solution within the current coin voting paradigm.</p>
<h3
id="problems-with-coin-voting-even-in-the-absence-of-attackers">Problems
with coin voting even in the absence of attackers</h3>
<p>The problems with coin voting even without explicit attackers are
increasingly well-understood (eg. see <a
href="https://dappradar.com/blog/decentralized-governance-in-defi-examples-and-pitfalls">this
recent piece by DappRadar and Monday Capital</a>), and mostly fall into
a few buckets:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Small groups of wealthy participants ("whales") are better
at successfully executing decisions than large groups of
small-holders</strong>. This is because of the tragedy of the commons
among small-holders: each small-holder has only an insignificant
influence on the outcome, and so they have little incentive to not be
lazy and actually vote. Even if there are rewards for voting, there is
little incentive to research and think carefully about what they are
voting for.</li>
<li><strong>Coin voting governance empowers coin holders and coin holder
interests at the expense of other parts of the community</strong>:
protocol communities are made up of diverse constituencies that have
many different values, visions and goals. Coin voting, however, only
gives power to one constituency (coin holders, and especially wealthy
ones), and leads to over-valuing the goal of making the coin price go up
even if that involves harmful rent extraction.</li>
<li><strong>Conflict of interest issues</strong>: giving voting power to
one constituency (coin holders), and especially over-empowering wealthy
actors in that constituency, risks over-exposure to the
conflicts-of-interest within that particular elite (eg. investment funds
or holders that <em>also</em> hold tokens of other DeFi platforms that
interact with the platform in question)</li>
</ul>
<p>There is one major type of strategy being attempted for solving the
first problem (and therefore also mitigating the third problem): <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy">delegation</a>.
Smallholders don't have to personally judge each decision; instead, they
can delegate to community members that they trust. This is an honorable
and worthy experiment; we shall see how well delegation can mitigate the
problem.</p>

<p>The problem of coin holder centrism, on the other hand, is
significantly more challenging: coin holder centrism is inherently baked
into a system where coin holder votes are the only input. The
mis-perception that coin holder centrism is an intended goal, and not a
bug, is already causing confusion and harm; one (broadly excellent) <a
href="https://otherinter.net/research/positive-sum-worlds/">article
discussing blockchain public goods</a> complains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can crypto protocols be considered public goods if ownership is
concentrated in the hands of a few whales? Colloquially, these market
primitives are sometimes described as "public infrastructure," but if
blockchains serve a "public" today, it is primarily one of decentralized
finance. Fundamentally, these tokenholders share only one common object
of concern: price.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The complaint is false; blockchains serve a public much richer and
broader than DeFi token holders. But our coin-voting-driven governance
systems are completely failing to capture that, and it seems difficult
to make a governance system that captures that richness without a more
fundamental change to the paradigm.</p>
<h3
id="coin-votings-deep-fundamental-vulnerability-to-attackers-vote-buying">Coin
voting's deep fundamental vulnerability to attackers: vote buying</h3>
<p>The problems get much worse once determined attackers trying to
subvert the system enter the picture. The fundamental vulnerability of
coin voting is simple to understand. <strong>A token in a protocol with
coin voting is a bundle of two rights that are combined into a single
asset: (i) some kind of economic interest in the protocol's revenue and
(ii) the right to participate in governance. This combination is
deliberate: the goal is to align power and responsibility. But in fact,
these two rights are very easy to unbundle from each other</strong>.
Imagine a simple wrapper contract that has these rules: if you deposit 1
XYZ into the contract, you get back 1 WXYZ. That WXYZ can be converted
back into an XYZ at any time, plus in addition it accrues dividends.
Where do the dividends come from? Well, while the XYZ coins are inside
the wrapper contract, it's the wrapper contract that has the ability to
use them however it wants in governance (making proposals, voting on
proposals, etc). The wrapper contract simply auctions off this right
every day, and distributes the profits among the original
depositors.</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/voting3-files/wrapper1.png"
class="padded" /></p>
<br>
</center>
<p>As an XYZ holder, is it in your interest to deposit your coins into
the contract? If you are a very large holder, it might not be; you like
the dividends, but you are scared of what a misaligned actor might do
with the governance power you are selling them. But if you are a smaller
holder, then it very much is. If the governance power auctioned by the
wrapper contract gets bought up by an attacker, you personally only
suffer a small fraction of the cost of the bad governance decisions that
your token is contributing to, but you personally gain the full benefit
of the dividend from the governance rights auction. This situation is a
classic tragedy of the commons.</p>
<p>Suppose that an attacker makes a decision that corrupts the DAO to
the attacker's benefit. The harm per participant from the decision
succeeding is <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, and the chance
that a single vote tilts the outcome is <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Suppose an attacker makes a bribe of
<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. The game chart looks like
this:</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Decision</th>
<th>Benefit to you</th>
<th>Benefit to others</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Accept attacker's bribe</td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(B - D * p\)</span></td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(-999 * D * p\)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Reject bribe, vote your conscience</td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(0\)</span></td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(0\)</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br>
</center>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(B &gt; D * p\)</span>, you are
inclined to accept the bribe, but as long as <span
class="math inline">\(B &lt; 1000 * D * p\)</span>, accepting the bribe
is <em>collectively</em> harmful. So if <span class="math inline">\(p
&lt; 1\)</span> (usually, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is far
below <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>), there is an opportunity
for an attacker to bribe users to adopt a net-negative decision,
compensating each user far less than the harm they suffer.</p>
<p>One natural critique of voter bribing fears is: are voters
<em>really</em> going to be so immoral as to accept such obvious bribes?
The average DAO token holder is an enthusiast, and it would be hard for
them to feel good about so selfishly and blatantly selling out the
project. But what this misses is that there are much more obfuscated
ways to separate out profit sharing rights from governance rights, that
don't require anything remotely as explicit as a wrapper contract.</p>
<p>The simplest example is borrowing from a defi lending platform (eg.
<a href="https://compound.finance/">Compound</a>). Someone who already
holds ETH can lock up their ETH in a CDP ("collateralized debt
position") in one of these platforms, and once they do that the CDP
contract allows them to borrow an amount of XYZ up to eg. half the value
of the ETH that they put in. They can then do whatever they want with
this XYZ. To recover their ETH, they would eventually need to pay back
the XYZ that they borrowed, plus interest.</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/voting3-files/wrapper2.png"
class="padded" /></p>
<br>
</center>
<p>Note that throughout this process, <em>the borrower has no financial
exposure to XYZ</em>. That is, if they use their XYZ to vote for a
governance decision that destroys the value of XYZ, they do not lose a
penny as a result. The XYZ they are holding is XYZ that they have to
eventually pay back into the CDP regardless, so they do not care if its
value goes up or down. <strong>And so we have achieved unbundling: the
borrower has governance power without economic interest, and the lender
has economic interest without governance power</strong>.</p>
<p>There are also centralized mechanisms for separating profit sharing
rights from governance rights. Most notably, when users deposit their
coins on a (centralized) exchange, the exchange holds full custody of
those coins, and the exchange has the ability to use those coins to
vote. This is not mere theory; there is evidence of exchanges using
their users' coins in several DPoS systems. The most notable recent
example is the <a
href="https://decrypt.co/38050/steem-steemit-tron-justin-sun-cryptocurrency-war">attempted
hostile takeover of Steem</a>, where exchanges used their customers'
coins to vote for some proposals that helped to cement a takeover of the
Steem network that the bulk of the community strongly opposed. The
situation was only resolved through an outright mass exodus, where a
large portion of the community moved to a different chain called <a
href="https://hive.io/">Hive</a>.</p>
<p>Some DAO protocols are using timelock techniques to limit these
attacks, requiring users to lock their coins and make them immovable for
some period of time in order to vote. These techniques can limit
buy-then-vote-then-sell attacks in the short term, but ultimately <a
href="https://blog.openzeppelin.com/bypassing-smart-contract-timelocks/">timelock
mechanisms can be bypassed</a> by users holding and voting with their
coins through a contract that issues a wrapped version of the token (or,
more trivially, a centralized exchange). <strong>As far as security
mechanisms go, timelocks are more like a paywall on a newspaper website
than they are like a lock and key.</strong></p>
<p>At present, many blockchains and DAOs with coin voting have so far
managed to avoid these attacks in their most severe forms. There are
occasional signs of attempted bribes:</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MonetSupply/status/1415526055348031489?s=19"><img src="../../../../images/voting3-files/bribeattempt.jpg" style="width:600px"/></a></p>
</br>
</center>
<p>But despite all of these important issues, there have been much fewer
examples of outright voter bribing, including obfuscated forms such as
using financial markets, that simple economic reasoning would suggest.
The natural question to ask is: why haven't more outright attacks
happened yet?</p>
<p>My answer is that the "why not yet" relies on three contingent
factors that are true today, but are likely to get less true over
time:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Community spirit</strong> from having a tightly-knit
community, where everyone feels a sense of camaraderie in a common tribe
and mission..</li>
<li><strong>High wealth concentration and coordination of token
holders</strong>; large holders have higher ability to affect the
outcome and have investments in long-term relationships with each other
(both the "old boys clubs" of VCs, but also many other equally powerful
but lower-profile groups of wealthy token holders), and this makes them
much more difficult to bribe.</li>
<li><strong>Immature financial markets</strong> in governance tokens:
ready-made tools for making wrapper tokens <a
href="https://blog.openzeppelin.com/bypassing-smart-contract-timelocks/">exist
in proof-of-concept forms</a> but are not widely used, bribing contracts
<a href="https://gitlab.com/relyt29/votebuying-carbonvote">exist</a> but
are similarly immature, and liquidity in lending markets is low.</li>
</ol>
<p>When a small coordinated group of users holds over 50% of the coins,
<em>and</em> both they and the rest are invested in a tightly-knit
community, and there are few tokens being lent out at reasonable rates,
all of the above bribing attacks may perhaps remain theoretical. But
over time, (1) and (3) will inevitably become less true no matter what
we do, and (2) <em>must</em> become less true if we want DAOs to become
more fair. When those changes happen, will DAOs remain safe? And if coin
voting cannot be sustainably resistant against attacks, then what
can?</p>
<h2 id="solution-1-limited-governance">Solution 1: limited
governance</h2>
<p>One possible mitigation to the above issues, and one that is to
varying extents being tried already, is to put limits on what
coin-driven governance can do. There are a few ways to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use on-chain governance only for applications, not base
layers</strong>: Ethereum does this already, as the protocol itself is
governed through off-chain governance, while DAOs and other apps on top
of this are sometimes (but not always) governed through on-chain
governance</li>
<li><strong>Limit governance to fixed parameter choices</strong>:
Uniswap does this, as it only allows governance to affect (i) token
distribution and (ii) a 0.05% fee in the Uniswap exchange. Another great
example is <a
href="https://docs.reflexer.finance/ungovernance/governance-minimization-guide">RAI's
"un-governance" roadmap</a>, where governance has control over fewer and
fewer features over time.</li>
<li><strong>Add time delays</strong>: a governance decision made at time
T only takes effect at eg. T + 90 days. This allows users and
applications that consider the decision unacceptable to move to another
application (possibly a fork). Compound <a
href="https://compound.finance/docs/governance">has a time delay
mechanism</a> in its governance, but in principle the delay can (and
eventually should) be much longer.</li>
<li><strong>Be more fork-friendly</strong>: make it easier for users to
quickly coordinate on and execute a fork. This makes the payoff of
capturing governance smaller.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Uniswap case is particularly interesting: it's an intended
behavior that the on-chain governance funds teams, which may develop
future versions of the Uniswap protocol, but <em>it's up to users to
opt-in</em> to upgrading to those versions. This is a hybrid of on-chain
and off-chain governance that leaves only a limited role for the
on-chain side.</p>
<p>But limited governance is not an acceptable solution by itself; those
areas where governance is needed the most (eg. funds distribution for
public goods) are themselves among the most vulnerable to attack. Public
goods funding is so vulnerable to attack because there is a very direct
way for an attacker to profit from bad decisions: they can try to push
through a bad decision that sends funds to themselves. Hence, we also
need techniques to improve governance itself...</p>
<h2 id="solution-2-non-coin-driven-governance">Solution 2:
non-coin-driven governance</h2>
<p>A second approach is to use forms of governance that are not
coin-voting-driven. But if coins do not determine what weight an account
has in governance, what does? There are two natural alternatives:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Proof of personhood systems</strong>: systems that verify
that accounts correspond to unique individual humans, so that governance
can assign one vote per human. See <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05300">here</a> for a review of some
techniques being developed, and <a
href="https://app.proofofhumanity.id/">ProofOfHumanity</a> and <a
href="https://www.brightid.org/">BrightID</a> and <a
href="https://github.com/idena-network">Idenanetwork</a> for three
attempts to implement this.</li>
<li><strong>Proof of participation</strong>: systems that attest to the
fact that some account corresponds to a person that has participated in
some event, passed some educational training, or performed some useful
work in the ecosystem. See <a href="https://poap.xyz/">POAP</a> for one
attempt to implement thus.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are also hybrid possibilities: one example is <a
href="../../../2019/12/07/quadratic.html">quadratic voting</a>, which
makes the power of a single voter proportional to the <em>square
root</em> of the economic resources that they commit to a decision.
Preventing people from gaming the system by splitting their resource
across many identities requires proof of personhood, and the
still-existent financial component allows participants to credibly
signal how strongly they care about an issue, as well as how strongly
they care about the ecosystem. Gitcoin quadratic funding is a form of
quadratic voting, and quadratic voting DAOs <a
href="https://gitcoin.co/issue/DemocracyEarth/DemocracyDAO/1">are being
built</a>.</p>
<p>Proof of participation is less well-understood. The key challenge is
that determining what counts as how much participation itself requires a
quite robust governance structure. It's possible that the easiest
solution involves bootstrapping the system with a hand-picked choice of
10-100 early contributors, and then decentralizing over time as the
selected participants of round N determine participation criteria for
round N+1. The possibility of a fork helps provide a path to recovery
from, and an incentive against, governance going off the rails.</p>
<p>Proof of personhood and proof of participation both require some form
of anti-collusion (see <a
href="../../../2019/04/03/collusion.html">article explaining the issue
here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/appliedZKP/maci">MACI
documentation here</a>) to ensure that the non-money resource being used
to measure voting power remains non-financial, and does not itself end
up inside of smart contracts that sell the governance power to the
highest bidder.</p>
<h2 id="solution-3-skin-in-the-game">Solution 3: skin in the game</h2>
<p>The third approach is to break the tragedy of the commons, by
changing the rules of the vote itself. <strong>Coin voting fails because
while voters are <em>collectively</em> accountable for their decisions
(if everyone votes for a terrible decision, everyone's coins drop to
zero), each voter is not <em>individually</em> accountable (if a
terrible decision happens, those who supported it suffer no more than
those who opposed it). Can we make a voting system that changes this
dynamic, and makes voters individually, and not just collectively,
responsible for their decisions?</strong></p>
<p>Fork-friendliness is arguably a skin-in-the-game strategy, if forks
are done in the way that Hive forked from Steem. In the case that a
ruinous governance decision succeeds and can no longer be opposed inside
the protocol, users can take it upon themselves to make a fork.
Furthermore, in that fork, the coins that voted for the bad decision can
be destroyed.</p>

</br>
</center>
<p>This sounds harsh, and perhaps it even feels like a violation of an
implicit norm that the "immutability of the ledger" should remain
sacrosanct when forking a coin. But the idea seems much more reasonable
when seen from a different perspective. We keep the idea of a strong
firewall where individual coin balances are expected to be inviolate,
<em>but only apply that protection to coins that do not participate in
governance</em>. If you participate in governance, even indirectly by
putting your coins into a wrapper mechanism, then you may be held liable
for the costs of your actions.</p>
<p><strong>This creates individual responsibility: if an attack happens,
and your coins vote for the attack, then your coins are
destroyed</strong>. If your coins do not vote for the attack, your coins
are safe. The responsibility propagates upward: if you put your coins
into a wrapper contract and the wrapper contract votes for an attack,
the wrapper contract's balance is wiped and so you lose your coins. If
an attacker borrows XYZ from a defi lending platform, when the platform
forks anyone who lent XYZ loses out (note that this makes lending the
governance token in general very risky; this is an intended
consequence).</p>
<h3 id="skin-in-the-game-in-day-to-day-voting">Skin-in-the-game in
day-to-day voting</h3>
<p>But the above only works for guarding against decisions that are
truly extreme. What about smaller-scale heists, which unfairly favor
attackers manipulating the economics of the governance but not severely
enough to be ruinous? And what about, in the absence of any attackers at
all, simple laziness, and the fact that coin-voting governance has no
selection pressure in favor of higher-quality opinions?</p>
<p>The most popular solution to these kinds of issues is <a
href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/08/21/introduction-futarchy/">futarchy</a>,
introduced by Robin Hanson in the early 2000s. Votes become bets: to
vote in favor of a proposal, you make a bet that the proposal will lead
to a good outcome, and to vote against the proposal, you make a bet that
the proposal will lead to a poor outcome. Futarchy introduces individual
responsibility for obvious reasons: if you make good bets, you get more
coins, and if you make bad bets you lose your coins.</p>
<center>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/election-files/chartovertime.png"
class="padded" /></p>
<br>
</center>
<p>"Pure" futarchy has proven difficult to introduce, because in
practice objective functions are very difficult to define (it's not just
coin price that people want!), but various hybrid forms of futarchy may
well work. Examples of hybrid futarchy include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Votes as buy orders</strong>: see <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/votes-as-buy-orders-a-new-type-of-hybrid-coin-voting-futarchy/10305">ethresear.ch
post</a>. Voting in favor of a proposal requires making an enforceable
buy order to buy additional tokens at a price somewhat lower than the
token's current price. This ensures that if a terrible decision
succeeds, those who support it may be forced to buy their opponents out,
but it also ensures that in more "normal" decisions coin holders have
more slack to decide according to non-price criteria if they so
wish.</li>
<li><strong>Retroactive public goods funding</strong>: see <a
href="https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c">post
with the Optimism team</a>. Public goods are funded by some voting
mechanism <em>retroactively</em>, after they have already achieved a
result. Users can buy <em>project tokens</em> to fund their project
while signaling confidence in it; buyers of project tokens get a share
of the reward if that project is deemed to have achieved a desired
goal.</li>
<li><strong>Escalation games</strong>: see <a
href="https://augur.net/blog/v2-resolution/">Augur</a> and <a
href="https://ipfs.kleros.io/ipfs/QmZeV32S2VoyUnqJsRRCh75F1fP2AeomVq2Ury2fTt9V4z/Dispute-Resolution-Kleros.pdf">Kleros</a>.
Value-alignment on lower-level decisions is incentivized by the
possibility to appeal to a higher-effort but higher-accuracy
higher-level process; voters whose votes agree with the ultimate
decision are rewarded.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the latter two cases, hybrid futarchy depends on some form of
non-futarchy governance to measure against the objective function or
serve as a dispute layer of last resort. However, this non-futarchy
governance has several advantages that it does not if used directly: (i)
it activates later, so it has access to more information, (ii) it is
used less frequently, so it can expend less effort, and (iii) each use
of it has greater consequences, so it's more acceptable to just rely on
forking to align incentives for this final layer.</p>
<h2 id="hybrid-solutions">Hybrid solutions</h2>
<p>There are also solutions that combine elements of the above
techniques. Some possible examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time delays plus elected-specialist governance</strong>:
this is one possible solution to the ancient conundrum of how to make an
crypto-collateralized stablecoin whose locked funds can exceed the value
of the profit-taking token without risking governance capture. The
stable coin uses a price oracle constructed from the median of values
submitted by N (eg. N = 13) elected providers. Coin voting chooses the
providers, but it can only cycle out one provider each week. If users
notice that coin voting is bringing in untrustworthy price providers,
they have N/2 weeks before the stablecoin breaks to switch to a
different one.</li>
<li><strong>Futarchy + anti-collusion = reputation</strong>: Users vote
with "reputation", a token that cannot be transferred. Users gain more
reputation if their decisions lead to desired results, and lose
reputation if their decisions lead to undesired results. See <a
href="https://medium.com/daostack/reputation-vs-tokens-6d7642c7a538">here</a>
for an article advocating for a reputation-based scheme.</li>
<li><strong>Loosely-coupled (advisory) coin votes</strong>: a coin vote
does not directly implement a proposed change, instead it simply exists
to make its outcome public, to build <a
href="../../../2021/03/23/legitimacy.html">legitimacy</a> for off-chain
governance to implement that change. This can provide the benefits of
coin votes, with fewer risks, as the legitimacy of a coin vote drops off
automatically if evidence emerges that the coin vote was bribed or
otherwise manipulated.</li>
</ul>
<p>But these are all only a few possible examples. There is much more
that can be done in researching and developing non-coin-driven
governance algorithms. <strong>The most important thing that can be done
today is moving away from the idea that coin voting is the only
legitimate form of governance decentralization</strong>. Coin voting is
attractive because it <em>feels</em> credibly neutral: anyone can go and
get some units of the governance token on Uniswap. In practice, however,
<strong>coin voting may well only appear secure today precisely because
of the imperfections in its neutrality</strong> (namely, large portions
of the supply staying in the hands of a tightly-coordinated clique of
insiders).</p>
<p>We should stay very wary of the idea that current forms of coin
voting are "safe defaults". There is still much that remains to be seen
about how they function under conditions of more economic stress and
mature ecosystems and financial markets, and the time is now to start
simultaneously experimenting with alternatives.</p>
